Incidentally, it was also from here, the Engineering Department, that this nickname began to spread.\nThat day, Repair Workshop No. 3 got a new intern smith named Alanna. She's a talented girl. On the day she reported in, she broke all the records for the funny-faces staring contests our old craftsmen regularly held. She even made fun of them: 'You can't beat me, much less Potlid!'\nAt first, the old workmen all thought that this 'Potlid' would be some gifted, stern master who had trained for years, only for Alanna to later tell them that Potlid is the girl who came here with her to get treated.\nThe craftsmen were all furious, and kept asking Alanna to bring Potlid there for a competition. As expected, they all lost.\nThe little girl opened her eyes wide, and her lips had but a faint curvature. No matter what kind of faces they made, she didn't move one bit.\nThe craftsmen all accepted their defeat afterwards. They even gave her an even more amazing nickname—'The 100 Degree Potlid.' But not because she can easily boil water with her Originium Arts, but rather—\nBecause the curvature of her smile forms a perfect 100 degree arc. Rock measured a photo of her with a protractor, and he was completely certain of this.\n—A certain Engineering operator\n\nBecause of her shocking performance during the match, the old craftsmen all thought she never laughed. They even suspected she was near-sighted and couldn't see the funny faces they made. Yet Alanna needed only to look into her eyes for Warmy to start laughing out loud and leap into her embrace—Not only did their hypothesis completely fall apart, they couldn't help but be amazed by how close the two of them felt, like a real family.\nOf course, the quick rise to fame of the name 'Potlid' owes much to Alanna's promotional ability, but the operators' contrarian nature likely played a role, too. After all... the way Warmy looks when she tells others to stop calling her Potlid is just so, so cute.\n\n[Engineering Department Voice Log]\n'What? You mean Potlid had been staying in the truck with you the whole time? She had it pretty rough, huh?'\n'Hey, what's that supposed to mean? A truck's like a hut you can take with you everywhere. How cool is that? Besides, do I look like I can't take care of a little girl? Don't underestimate—'\n'Don't be so cocksure, Alanna. I've only met her a few times, but I can tell she's got a lot on her mind that she can't figure out. That could easily push her to go overboard.'\n'Tsk, of course I know that...\n'...She's stubborn and patient. She doesn't want the people around her to worry, and that's why she always puts up that cheerful face.\n'But you can cover a pot with a lid all you want. It won't keep the water from boiling over. That's why I make sure to help her let out some steam every now and then.'",

            "storyText": "Above the Taragangils' main ore veins—where countless chunks of Originium ore lie hidden—are an equally large number of Rim Billitonian mining towns. It was in one such small town where Warmy was born. However, not long after, her mother left home to remarry and was never heard from again, so the young Warmy lived alone with her miner father and slowly grew up to the ceaseless roar of the town's machinery and the pounding echoes of its hammers.\nThat said, not having a mother around doesn't seem to have had much of a negative effect on her. This is because every adult in town took on the role of caretaker during her upbringing. Just as there are Rim Billitonians who describe such towns as 'one big family,' the towns serve a much greater purpose than simply being Rim Billiton's most fundamental political unit. They are also where their labor creates value. Most importantly, the mining towns connect each and every small family together. Here, every child is everyone's child.\n'The workers in town all treated me really well!\n'The fat man always lost to Dad when they played cards together. Whenever he won just once, he'd get overjoyed for days!\n'...I lived with him ever since that day. He told me that he won more than enough to raise me to adulthood.\n'There was the radish leaves old lady, too. Dad always hid from her, saying that the way she talked was just like the broadcast station's loudspeakers, because she'd tell everybody about that time her went into the mine shaft with his trousers inside-out—\n'But she helped me ask around about Dad everywhere. She also made the other workers go to other mines to put up missing person posters, and she took me to... where the accident happened.\n'They were all okay with me staying there, but I wanted to look for Dad... That's why, I got on the truck, and left town.'\nWarmy once told us in vivid detail how the workers spent their time in the open field in the center of the kitchen after a day's work—They played ball, wrestled, and danced together. Whenever they wanted to relax, they gathered to chat or set up lawn chairs to watch an outdoor movie. The older workers spent their spare time teaching everyone necessary life skills, and Warmy sometimes joined in on the lessons. We understand this to be the origin of her outstanding culinary techniques.\n'If only the food I cook could cure everybody of Oripathy...' Perhaps it is because of the warm and simple lifestyle of the residents of such mining towns that such a childish and romantic wish has taken root in Warmy's heart.",

Most of the visitors today are friends and family of the trapped miners. The mines' reps are telling me to calm them down, but after something like this...?\nWhat's more, the mailroom got a letter with a flower sticker today. It looks like a kid's handwriting, and the recipient's name is on the list of personnel we lost contact with.\nThis year's winter is so cold.\n......\nDecember 24, 1095\nVisitors: 138\nWork Log: Most of the visitors today are family members here to claim remains or sign their indemnifications. They all looked exhausted and numb. I can't help but wonder how many times these mothers, wives, and siblings have been through this systematic, almost inhuman process?\nThe girl waited by the shutters till midnight. We couldn't find her father's remains, but we were able to find a brooch with a picture of a father and daughter inside, among the pile of unclaimed items. The girl took it with her. I sure hope that's going to cheer her up, at least a little.\nSpeaking of which, it wasn't until I saw the picture that I remembered I had met the guy... He always waved at me when he got to work in the mornings. I'll never forget that hand missing the ring finger, yet I never even knew his name.\n......\nDecember 31, 1095\nVisitors: 27\nWork Log: We held a party and wrapped up work early today. We signed for a bunch of fireworks and cannonballs, ten crates each. We also had a bunch of New Year gift boxes meant for the workers—the company placed that order a couple weeks ago. In the end, we couldn't even manage to hand out half of them.\nThe girl stopped by again. She had a small clay pot with her, and she sat on a stone block on the side of the road the whole time. When she heard the cheerful voices celebrating the New Year coming from inside the chapel, she smiled and closed her eyes, like she was making a wish.\nIn the end, she gave me that pot of stew. It was still warm. I can tell she still hasn't found the person she's been waiting for.\nHappy New Year.\n......\nJanuary 19, 1096\nVisitors: 284\nWork Log: It's been a full month since the accident, and we're getting plenty of familiar faces. This is the first time we've had so many flowers piled up in that tattered corner by the wall. I've heard some workers talk about the investigation report of the accident. As you'd expect, the company determined it was completely unforeseen and could not possibly have been predicted. Whether it was a natural or manmade disaster, they simply wrote it off as an 'accident.'\nOn another note, I heard that the daughter of the man who lost his finger has been riding trucks to other mines to look for her father. What's even more heart-wrenching is that apparently she caught Oripathy by accident a while back... Silly girl.\n......\nJanuary 26, 1096\nVisitors: 5\nWork Log: Not a lot of visitors, nothing important that needs to be recorded.\nI saw that girl again. She was curled up on the station's bench. No idea why she didn't stop by to register or ask me if I've seen her father like before.\nThere was a pretty brazen-looking truck driver who asked me all about that kid. I couldn't be bothered to tell her, but she was determined to get herself involved. What a weirdo.\n......\n—From the notebook always carried by a certain desk worker at the mines",

They might all be waiting for Warmy's fresh-off-the-stove 'Soup of the Day.'\nIn just the blink of an eye, that tiny figure appeared with a big tray and captured everybody's attention. Everyone noticed that not only did today's soup come with a range of options encompassing the favorites of many of our operators, there were also some small bites prepared by Warmy.\n'If that doesn't fill you up, we still have more in the pot! And if there's anything you want to eat, just let me know anytime! It's okay if it's not Rim Billitonian! I'll learn how to make it!' Ever since then, she actually learned to cook up a variety of authentic dishes from all across Terra, and no one's doubted that promise of hers ever again.\nWarmy is slowly learning how to properly use the stove's staff, with which she is able to adjust the heat to accurately control her food's temperature and really show off her skills in the kitchen. Combined with how she has learned to prepare the favorite dishes of many of our operators by heart, she has come to be known as the Gourmet Magician by Rhodes Island's pickiest foodies... Who could have predicted the tiny Infected girl who had to be closely monitored just a couple months ago coming this far?\n\n['Potlid' Patient Visitor Menu]\n......\nSour Olive Fin Soup\nNote: Might be a bit sour, but Hibiscus says sour foods help stir the appetite, which in turn helps absorb the nutrients in the fin meat!\n\nHoppy Potato Pie\nNote: Main dish for filling bellies.

Macarons\nNote: Be sure to make these!\n—One of the operators helping out at the rear kitchen pointed out that it is a lot of work to make these macarons for dessert, but Warmy insisted on making them nonetheless. After careful consideration, she chose a name that she thought best suited the dessert.\n\n[Classified Log]\nAlthough each country or territory has its own policies toward the Infected, their marginalization nonetheless remains a common sight all across Terra. Prejudice has made it difficult for adult Infected to even live in the sunlight, not to mention children who lack decision-making capacity and have yet to fully mature. As a landship that provides Oripathy treatment services, Rhodes Island has taken in thousands of Infected children from all across Terra. Each of them endures unquantifiable bodily pain. Some were abandoned by their families and society, and some even chose to exile themselves—As such, in addition to bringing the Infected children's Oripathy under control, we must help them learn skills with which they can assimilate into society. This is something that cannot be neglected.\n...We truly hope that there will be nothing keeping these children from growing up healthy, be it poverty, war, or Oripathy itself.\n—Excerpts from a Rhodes Island Medical Department children's rights report",

It was only meant to be a normal birthday wish, yet it became the guiding principle of her life—After all, those were her father's final expectations of her.\nBecause of this, she began to hide all her more complicated emotions—especially the overly negative ones—behind a shockingly bright smile. To the point that, in her heart, she beautified even all the misfortunes she's had to bear. For a very long time, she wandered all over to look for her father, but nonetheless kept smiling despite all the setbacks she suffered. Even the tragedy that is getting infected with Oripathy was nothing to be sad about, as she truly believed that she would one day reunite with her father, and so must always look forward to that moment with a smile.\nEvery kind of emotional display is meaningful in some way. That is especially true for a small child like Warmy. It's a good thing that her psychological condition seems to have improved after her journey to the Grinning Valley. She has started to throw tantrums when Alanna calls her 'Potlid' in front of others, and now when Ray tells her stories of legendary animals, she shows a sense of surprise and curiosity that she rarely ever displayed. Most importantly, whenever she thinks about her father, and whenever she feels pain from her Oripathy, she doesn't simply hold it in anymore. This is a good thing, and is worthy of further observation.\nLet us look forward to her future growth together.",
