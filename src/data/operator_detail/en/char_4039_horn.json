            "storyText": "As a professional officer, there is no question that Horn possesses excellent combat skill and tactical accomplishment. Her customary weapon is a specialized shield, with an arming mechanism able to burst up to ten rounds in an extremely short time.\nJust as with Bagpipe's piledriver spear, Horn's shield displays the terrifying might of Victoria's standard ordnance. Londinium is currently in a unique phase, and being in cooperation, we've performed repairs on the weapons borne by Horn and the Victorian soldiers she leads. In the initial stages of work, even the mechanical structure of her shield eluded us.\n'Jeez, no wonder Victoria's got the most advanced mechanical engineering on all of Terra. I can't even picture how I'd develop these weapons any further,' were Closure's words, demonstrating even her awe.\nFortunately, Horn assisted us in disassembling the most difficult parts. Her past military exercises had given her a considerably professional grasp on mechanical technology. With her knowledge, she and the city defense force soldiers fashioned their crossbows and grenades by themselves during a period when supplies were extremely scarce. It's no exaggeration to say that Horn has once again made us find how outstanding the professionalism of Victorian soldiers is.\n'Are you SURE the Royal Guard Academy teaches mechanical engineering? Then what about all the control terminals Bagpipe's wrecked on the ship?!' Addition of this remark has been strongly requested by Closure following perusal of the above paragraph.\nAlso, while this should probably go in the armament evaluation logs, I'll add these battlefield observation records below too, considering we have a shortage of hands on deck for Londinium operations.\nHorn's performance on the battlefield is extremely professional. On top of an all-round, comprehensive combat capacity, she has rich experience in squad command. This completely matches our first impressions, and is a strong fit to Bagpipe's descriptions.\nBut in a few, extremely challenging battles, I and a few other operators witnessed a shift. I might not have been exact under such tense circumstances, so it could be that any change in eye and hair color was my misconception. But it was difficult to ignore her sudden rise in speed, and how vastly different her destructive fighting techniques were to her former restrained and controlled combat style.\nOut of curiosity, I asked the other Victorian soldiers if they knew anything, and heard a few rumors about the White Wolf who was active in the Victorian Army. A white Lupo went mad in Sargon on a moonlit night and tore an entire army to death for an Aslan pasha however many thousand years ago, the White Wolf Count ripped a Vampire prince to shreds with his bare hands however many hundred years ago, and so on... I mean, they just sound like stories that get spread through the streets.\nBut a Medical Department colleague got back to me, and in their view, that kind of combat style would still put a heavy strain on the body, regardless of if she used some unique Originium Arts or activated some hereditary ability in the moment. We're fully aware of how far Horn can go to protect her soldiers and Victoria's civilians, but we hope she won't go that far so lightly.",

            "storyText": "The Tempest Platoon of Victoria is a special forces unit established by the Victorian Parliament. Formerly known as the Exemplars of Victoria, its main duty is to carry out special missions assigned directly by Parliament, with traces of its activity covering all of Victoria, including her enclaves everywhere.\nStructurally, the current Tempest Platoon is still attached to the Victorian Army, and is deployed to the frontline for assault duties in times of war, but is in reality relatively independent. The Platoon is divided into six sections, each section incorporating two operational groups, each operational group typically consisting of five members. The Platoon's members are typically selected for excellence from either other special forces units or the Royal Police, and undergo extremely harsh training. By and large, they possess all-encompassing combat abilities and exceptional intelligence analysis capacity, and are outfitted with the technological cutting edge of Victoria's equipment.\nDue to the Members who first founded the Exemplars themselves being Royal Guard Academy alumni, the Tempest Platoon has always had inextricable ties with this prestigious military school, from the day of its founding to present times. Every so often, some of the most outstanding graduates will receive recommendation letters from their instructors, which serve as the door to training and evaluation. Nobody on the outside is able to find out anything regarding the ratio of people who pass. Given the standards of the two Tempest Platoon soldiers we've already come into contact with, we imagine that even should one have graduated from the RGA, becoming a formal member of the Tempest Platoon must be considerably challenging.\nAs for Horn herself, anyone who's met her will know that she represents the Tempest Platoon of Victoria's ideal essence. Bravery, loyalty, tenacity, wiping out all that blocks the way as a tempest does. She will fight with her life on the line, for Victoria, for every innocent life of Her people, until the last blood is shed. You know, it's obvious she's of noble birth, isn't it? The child of a prestigious family must've had her pick of options, even if she didn't happen to be the favorite child. She could've served as the trusted aide of a Londinium VIP, or had a cushier time as a commander high up in the Army. Wouldn't anything have been better than joining the Tempest Platoon, doing nothing but the most wearisome and dangerous work?\nThe White Wolf Count... If she's the 'White Wolf,' so to speak, then maybe I can guess. Since the upheaval two decades or so ago, nobility loyal to the Royal Family, especially those in the military, went through harder times. Count Skamandros had been nestling in the border city of Caladon for years by that point. The 'White Wolf's' prowess in the military still remained, and many a Duke feared crossing him, but any of the slightest indication from him could wipe out his whole family then and there. I hear Horn hasn't been back to see her father in years, too. If her choice to join the Tempest Platoon right after graduating is any indication, she likely doesn't approve of her father receding away in self-protection.\nVictoria's future certainly isn't held in the hands of the old nobility entering their elder years, unable to uphold even their past splendor. Whether Victoria becomes the next Gaul will ultimately be seen in the choices made by the young, those like Horn and Bagpipe.\n\nâ€”Personal log of Rhodes Island intelligence personnel stationed in Victoria",

            "storyText": "Londinium's in a hell of a mess. Yeah, the situation's more grim than we were assuming.\nTheresis is taking measures on every front. The Nachzehrer's leading the Royal Court's army out of Londinium right now. Between him and the dukes' forces, they're keeping each other gagged.\nAs for the power which killed Outcast, Dublinn, you guessed right. They were cozy with a couple of nobles after all.\nSeems now they're trying to get a message to Theresis. Maybe they want to wrangle a partnership.\nGoing by the intel we picked up, odds are rock-bottom that Theresis allies with Dublinn at this stage. He's not going to trust any promises from a mysterious organization who wasn't there yesterday, and he's not going to be arrogant enough to set sights on any city beyond Londinium.\nBut we have to consider worst-case.\nVictoria might just be torn to pieces. The dukes could be provoked into action by Theresis, Dublinn, maybe some other schemer from out of nowhere, and the whole nation would fall into civil strife.\nObviously, Theresis had everything planned, from the moment he got the one Duke's invitation to enter Londinium and put down the rebellion. He had under ten thousand Sarkaz with him when he left Kazdel, but now? Londinium's military factories are producing arms for Theresis day and night. The Nachzehrer's got whatever secret channels he's found, and they're funneling Sarkaz soldiers in from every surrounding nation, straight to Theresis.\nWe still don't know what exactly Theresis is planning, but if this enters all-out warfare, what percent of those soldiers convened there do you figure are leaving Londinium alive?\nAnd after the war's over, even if Victoria can't help itself, it's not like the Sarkaz'll get anything good out of it either. You've seen the way Theresis retaliated against Victoria. Will Kazdel once again become the target of every nation in the centrum? Will we bring a new disaster?\nI don't know, Kal'tsit. You and Blaze always tell me I think too much, but there's only so much I can do. So it's always been.\nAs for Theresis and the Military Commission's plans. I believe Logos and Ascalon are more impatient than I am. All I can do for now is keep going with this Dublinn unit, figure out just what they intend on. If any intel of worth shows up, I'll send it back immediately. I know you've brought up the Draco before, Outcast's rescuee from County Hillock. Once she's ready, she'll give us more info, even help us figure out the truth of Dublinn. In which case, I hope the intel I get will help her make the decision to, ASAP.\nRight. One more thingâ€”I discovered a young Victorian officer in the Dublinn unit's camp. Dead ringer for Bagpipe's 'Leader.' Her commander she described.\nI've been keeping visuals on her for a time, out of caution. You know and I know that there's no looking at how Theresis went uncontested into Londinium without seeing the support from the Londinium army's top echelons. I trust how Bagpipe feels strongly about her leader, but just the same, I firmly believe a cruel war can reshape anyone's sense of wisdom.\nShe wasn't looked after kindly by Dublinn. County Hillockâ€”Mandragora and her subordinatesâ€”they insulted her, mocked her, constantly. They didn't put her through excessive physical torture. Maybe they still saw worth in her as a bargaining chip. Actually, no. Let me state this right. For an officer in the prime of her youth, there is no punishment more cruel than having to watch on helplessly while your comrades-in-arms are slaughtered, while you fall into enemy hands with no way to resist.\nI've seen a lot of POWs before. Most lose the will to fight. Life with an interminably long sentence does that to you. Maybe they let hate swallow all their reason.\nI didn't expect her to still be sane. But she was.\nMultiple times, I saw her fall asleep reading out her deceased comrades' names, then bolt awake shouting those same names, but I never saw tears in her eyes. There was still fire in them. The longing to survive and change it all. It was a fire that burned away her sorrow, led her to triumph over despair.\nI even doubt myself, owing to that. Am I too pessimistic? Maybe enough to forget I can lift my head, and behind Londinium's dark clouds, there are still a million morning stars waiting.\nI'm convinced, tomorrow, or this evening, she'll attempt to make her break.\nKal'tsit. It's my belief I should help her. \n\nâ€”Misery",

After having learned of Bagpipe's experiences over the past several months, Horn fell into a prolonged silence.\n'I knew she'd follow orders and press on the whole way, but I didn't... think it'd force her to retire from duty.'\nHorn said little more regarding Bagpipe's choice, or Victoria's situation, or the emergence of traitors in the Army.\nShe still throws herself into battle after battle, but in the intervals between combat, we often see her laughing as she chats with her fellow soldiers. Horn has a unique sense of humor, always able to find something to say that makes others crack a smile, no matter how grave the situation. This has quickly closed the distance between her and everyone else.\nAll soldiers, regardless of their birthplace, whether city defense or ordinary workers, or even Rhodes Island operators from other nations' lands, find it easy as could be to relax around Horn.\nThis isn't solely due to her combat and command ability that inspire confidence, nor her admirable uprightness and strength, but moreso her uncanny ability to see through her soldiers' worries and fears at a blink, and use appropriate methods to help adjust everyone's moods.\nHowever, we've gradually begun to worry for her. Who'll be there to ease her mind?\nShe's transformed herself into the shield she bears, firm, steady, and seemingly forever to be the last one standing.\nBut there's only so much time any armament has.\nWhen a human's forced herself to the extreme, and been stressed for too long, what will happen to her the instant the pressure on her disappears?\nIf possible, we'd like it for Horn not just to bring joy to everyone, but to be able to share any pain with us too, as her fellow operators do.\nPerhaps, after reading this file, it'll be in you to reach out to her. To not just bring her to stand side by side with you on the battlefield, but to invite her with you, to truly enjoy even the briefest moments of respite.",

      "desc": "Horn sat up against a tree. A shell had punched a hole through its trunk. The breeze passed through the decaying wood, giving off a mournful sound like some sort of crude instrument.\nAt least it was quieter than the battlefield. Horn was about to rest for a while, but found herself approached as soon as she closed her eyes. 'Here ye are, Captain!' Bagpipe leaned on the officer, her chin resting on her shoulder. Finding it too heavy, Horn tried to pull away, but Bagpipe's Vouivre strength was too great. 'Took me ages to find you,' Bagpipe batted her eyelashes, her tone pitiable, 'Ages and ages.'\nMaybe she was just too tired, she fell sleep. Horn felt guilty about it. As leader of Tempest Platoon, she shouldn't have left her people to go off for a nap. How was the battle going? Had Triangle's recon team returned? Was Bagpipe's injury bothering her? A pile of questions clogged her throat. Footsteps and laughter sounded from behind. Oboe was probably telling bad jokes again, Cello laughed a little later than the others but always the loudest, slapping Oboe's shoulder until he begged for mercy. Bagpipe finally let go of Horn's arm, hopped up, and waved vivaciously to her platoonmates.\nHorn wanted desperately to turn around, but she couldn't. She knew deep down that behind her was nothing but a hole. She couldn't turn around. If she did, those voices would vanish.\n'What sort of dream were you having?' Rosalie's voice dripped with her usual teasing tone, 'Wouldn't hurt to let me take first place once in a while, would it? You're so tired you're out as soon as you hang your head. How unlike you.'\nHorn saw the closed book beside her, with a thin green pen stuck inside. Rosalie had recently taken up felting on the grounds that it relieved the stress of finals. She insisted the tan ball in her hand was Horn's head. Horn repeatedly countered that her hair was a platinum blonde, but Rosalie didn't listen.\n'What did you dream about? The war again?' Rosalie put down her unfinished felt, tapping her chin curiously, 'What does the future look like in your dreams? I'm still thinking about what I might do after graduation. Logistics seems a bit boring. Perhaps I'll be a staff officer? Ooh, I wonder what my first fight will be like? I'll have to count these leisurely days while I still can.'\nUnfortunately, time waits for no woman. The half-finished felt lay on the ground, having turned a muddy color. Horn couldn't guess how Rosalie might craft her face, and she'll never get a chance to find out. She couldn't even remember clearly what Rosalie looked like. The friends had always liked to sit in the brightest places, her bright green hair, her smug smile, they all melted in the fiery sunlight.\nA pair of rough hands landed on Horn's face. She recalled how every time she napped under the maple tree in the yard, her grandmother would walk over and fan her, relieving the heat of the sun and shooing away the flies. This was still a dream, certainly, but this time she was lucid, and she had no intention of opening her eyes. She used to bother her grandmother for stories about the army, her great-great grandfather, and the feats of White Wolves past. Then, she dreamed of fighting for Victoria, just like her ancestors. Now that the war had truly begun, her dreams turned to her grandmother fanning her.\nSteady and strong, the rhythm was more comforting than sleep itself. Horn opened her eyes, and Feist gave her an apologetic smile. He didn't want to wake her with his work. Her shield needed maintenance too. Horn lowered her head and a gust of wind blew by, tiny buds falling from the trees, covering the mottled shield.\nSo, the cannonfire hadn't totally killed her tree after all.",

      "desc": "When Horn arrives at that modest Highbury pub, it's already packed. Over a dozen people's heads, Bagpipe waves vigorously to her, jostling half her pint out of the glass before she even makes it all the way over. Once she does, Bagpipe pushes it into Horn's hands, turns, orders a new one, and pours that one straight down the hatch. Her face is ruddy red and altogether sweaty. She's been helping out no small amount here, Horn can tell.\n'Y'know Robben? This is his relative, proper handy, you can just smell the fresh grain off the tipple he brews. Makes you feel all warm inside,' Bagpipe says glowingly. 'C'mon, Leader, try some.'\nHorn stares down at the mellow golden liquid. Just as warm as every other color in this bar. Londinium's past the worst of scarcity, but the workers still use curtains and tablecloths from their own homes to decorate this place out of sheer habit. The pub reopening means a lot to the neighborhood. Real proof that they have their livelihoods back, and a place to drop by after clock-out too.\nOnce the music starts up, Bagpipe tugs a dumbstruck Horn to come along. Bagpipe's kilt is long and flowing and gorgeous as she spins, aglow like a daffodil, like the paraffin lamp by your bedside. It makes Horn conscious of how she's not in uniform either. Her white pencil skirt was rummaged out of her old wardrobe from her academy days. Still fits, but she feels so strange in it. Like two empty hands missing their sword and shield.\n'Leader, move your body a bit! No one's goin' tae laugh at ye.' Bagpipe thinks she's embarrassed. 'Look, just follow ma rhythm now, it isnae hard at all!'\n<i>What rhythm?</i> Horn can't help but crack up at that. If skipping to the beat were a class, Fiona Young'd be losing every last mark.\nReturning to the counter, Horn once again picks up the pintglass Bagpipe got her, and in one fell swoop, downs it.\n'Tastes wonderful,' she grins. 'To Robben.'\n'To Robben,' Bagpipe echoes.\n'And to Abigail, and to Henderson, and to Gwen...' Horn sets the empty glass down. 'Gwen. Hah. What was it, that ale? The one Cello loved more than anything in the whole wide land?'\nBy the time they leave the bar, Horn's walking on much slower legs. With a gust of the evening wind, she makes her way to the curbside, and stoops down low.\n'Leader? Och, go on, chuck it up. You'll feel better for it.'\nHorn shakes her head, but her shoulders are tensing up anyway.\nPicking up on something silent, Bagpipe lifts her hand away before it can land on Horn's back, and opts to places it on her shoulder instead.\nHorn finally raises her head again. Quite unlike Bagpipe would've imagined, her mouth curls up, and her eyes are aglitter.\n'Bagpipe, they came out with my test results. My wounds are more or less recovered, and I didn't get Oripathy.'\nBagpipe grins back. She lifts Horn up, and the two amble together down the still and quiet street.\n'We're so lucky, you and I,' Bagpipe says.\n'Yeah.' Drawing a deep breath, Horn looks out at the faraway city walls, and the warm lights above it that faintly swim into view. 'So lucky.'",
