As such, the Notarial Hall still has the right to issue him tasks. In this sense, the additional title does not seem to have any particular impact on the normal course of his work.\nUpon his return to Rhodes Island, his outward appearance had certainly changed from before, if nothing else.\nBased on his own explanation, as well as corroborating accounts from a number of excited operators, we learned that the entire outfit he now wears was provided by the Lateran Curia, carefully tailored from completely different materials than ordinary clothing. It emphasizes not only aesthetics and comfort, but also practicality. With Executor's permission, we carried out a number of tests on his garb, which demonstrated that it boasts features such as impact and puncture resistance, and even a certain degree of anti-riot protection.\nThe two guns he carries have also attracted the attention of some Sankta operators. While dual wielding, his combat style is more aggressive than before, and his methods of attack more diverse.\n'During the last mission, Federico used his stock to knock out every enemy who got close to him,' commented Operator Spuria. 'His fighting style has nothing to do with how many guns you cram into his hands. Even with just a stick, or barehanded, that guy'll get the job done.\n'Huh? You wanna know why they went through all that effort to give him a makeover?\n'Because everyone thought it'd be badass, duh!'\n\n[Engineering Department Classified Log]\nRegarding the mechanical object that always follows Operator Executor, at first I thought it was some unique type of drone. However, while going over recordings of his battles, I saw it in action. The number of functions it has... far surpasses that of an ordinary auxiliary drone.\nBut it seems that even he himself doesn't know much about it, claiming that it was handed to him directly by His Holiness the Pope.\nWhat IS the secret behind this tiny little thing? It's really gnawing away at me, and I sure wish I had the chance to take it apart and see what makes it tick...",

Not at all. If someone who normally scores a 90 on exams got an extra point one day, nobody would bat an eye. However, if someone who only ever turns in blank exams suddenly started filling in the answers... Of course that would turn some heads.\nThe situation with Executor is similar. Several operators who've had contact with him have mentioned that he has begun to ask them questions in casual settings.\n'He asked why I didn't just kidnap the client right back...'\n'Haha, he let you off easy. He asked ME why I didn't just blow up the whole building to prevent the target from escaping...'\n'...So what'd you tell him?'\n'What else? The truth. Putting on a fireworks show might seem like the most straightforward option in the moment, but the cleanup afterwards would be an absolute nightmare!'\n'Did he listen?'\n'Seems like it. So what'd you answer?'\n'Uhh, about the same. Abducting the guy would've been faster, but dealing with the fallout would've been too much of a headache.'\n'As for Executor... He said that while he doesn't quite understand, after giving it some thought, he agreed that our way is more sensible and efficient.'\n\nThese unusual changes in Executor have attracted the attention of many. Based on the recent feedback we've received, we can surmise that he is trying to take more factors into account when determining what the most logical course of action is. Moreover, he's already putting this into practice, regularly attempting to complete tasks in a better and more reasonable manner.\n\n'It's like he just got patched with a new algorithm. It's better than before, but still spits out some weird results from time to time.'\n'Are you talking about when he went to console the target after defeating a group of bandits, just like you suggested, except he was completely covered in blood so he scared them half to death with his emotionless face?'\n\n[Medical Department Work Log]\nWe've received feedback from a number of our personnel that Executor seems to believe he is suffering from some kind of disease, manifesting as the sporadic prioritization of certain actions, some of which he finds perplexing. As a result, he has been going to Medical for regular physical examinations at an unnecessarily high frequency.\n'It's good to want to stay on top of your health. Not saying it isn't.' A member of Medical complained to us with an air of resignation. 'But there's nothing wrong with him, seriously. Except mentally.'\n\nAs an aside:\nSome members of Medical actually welcome Operator Executor's behavior, and are discussing using his case as an example to those patients who really need checkups but refuse to show up.",

Although it is unclear why His Holiness bestowed him the title of Saint at such a sensitive juncture, I do believe that if anyone can shoulder the Pope's expectations, it is that exceptional young man.\nHis background? Of course there's nothing problematic. As I recall, his parents were also affiliated with the Fifth Tribunal... Hold on, I'll go pull up their records. Ah, here we are, Mr. and Mrs. Giallo. Both were statutory executors with the Notarial Hall, both very capable. Unfortunately, they passed away during a mission fifteen years ago. Federico would only have been about ten years old at the time? Poor child...\nSo, what made you suddenly decide to look into him? The whole 'Saint' thing?\n...It's about Arturia Giallo?\n...First, let me make this abundantly clear:\nFederico's files were strictly reviewed at the time of his onboarding, and there were no issues.\nKeep that in mind, as it will be the premise for the rest of our conversation.\nArturia Giallo. Her father and Federico's father were cousins, as is unambiguously stated in the documents; there's nothing to hide. After the death of the Giallos in the line of duty, Federico stayed at his cousin's household for a period of... about two or three years, after which entered middle school and began living on campus.\nIncidentally, when Arturia's crimes first came to light seven years ago, forcing her to leave Laterano, it was Federico, then a newcomer, who pieced together the relevant clues. Since then, he's made efforts to raise the priority of the mission to bring her into custody. I'd imagine that a young man's first case must have special significance to him.\nNo, I don't think there's anything problematic about that. We carried out a detailed investigation when Arturia first became a wanted fugitive. As far as I know, Federico and Arturia were never in close contact, and there is no reason to believe it would affect his work – his day-to-day performance speaks for itself.\n\n[Fifth Tribunal Internal Conversation Log 2]\nArturia stayed at Sanctilaminium Ambrosii for a week, after which we decided that she would go to Leithanien; the relevant investigation reports have been sent to the Notarial Hall.\nHis Holiness has other plans for follow-up investigations and related matters, which I cannot disclose in advance.\nA sister?\nFrom a biological perspective, Arturia is only my distant relative, and I have no need for such informal relationships.

            "storyText": "When we use the term 'Saint,' it may evoke images of the Saints of the Iberian Inquisition. Though the term was originally borrowed from the Lateran faith, the concept has been fully absorbed by Iberia, is iconic to its people, and has taken on its own unique cultural expression.\nFor the Laterans, however, 'Saint' is not just a title to be thrown around haphazardly.\nIn all the classics relating to Lateran history, there are records of the first generation of Saints erecting stone towers and building the Holy City. The first group of Sanktas led everyone to lay the foundations for Laterano, and only after generations of hard work did they create a peace to continue for thousands of years. Only then did we finally have a society elevated above the flames of war – harmonious Laterano.\nWith the exception of the first group of sages who established the city-state, only the Pope is ever bestowed the title of Saint, during their term in office. This is not only a great honor, but also represents the weighty responsibility to lead the Sankta, as well as all of Laterano. For thousands of years, this title has without exception been passed down from generation to generation through the Pope – until this millennia old tradition was broken by the decision of Yvangelista XI.\nFederico Giallo became the first non-Papal canonization in thousands of years.\nWhy would the Pope make such an unprecedented decision? There is no doubt that Executor is excellent at his job, but Laterano has no shortage of combatants who are braver or more skilled than he, and no shortage of devotees more faithful. There also a litany of other prestigious figures, so everyone had the same question: why Federico? Why 'Saint?'\nHis undeniably excellent performance aside, the situation seems somewhat less shocking thanks to his detached attitude and the unique circumstances surrounding Laterano, but without a doubt, the decision made by His Holiness goes completely against common sense and warrants astonishment.\nWhy did the sitting Pope, in all his wisdom, make this decision, and what signal is he sending? Operator Executor told us that the Pope informed him that a disaster would befall this land, but what sort of disaster would force Laterano, a city that has been peaceful for thousands of years, to take such urgent measures?\nFederico Giallo was his first appointment, but what comes next? Will we also see Laterano appoint a second or third unconventional Saint?\nDr. Kal'tsit seems to be very concerned by the news coming from Operator Executor and Laterano. I think... it may be prudent to start preparing in advance.\n\n[Excerpt from Kal'tsit's Personal Records]\nThere is no doubt in my mind that His Holiness has issued us a warning. Calamity is coming, and Laterano will not be able to survive alone. It may even be the case that... the calamity will destroy Laterano first.\nThis so-called 'canonization' is undoubtedly the countermeasure chosen by Yvangelista XI.\nA 'Saint'... One who guides all Laterans, is it?\nThen there cannot be only one such person. Perhaps we will soon see more of these unconventional cases, more non-standard Lateran Saints.\nThey will become Laterano's cornerstones, a sign of hope amidst the coming calamity, the symbols of another way forward for the Sankta.\nAs for this calamity... \nI still can't give a definitive answer, but things are becoming clearer and clearer within my mind.\nThere are too many signs, too many omens.\nIt is coming, and soon.",

We'll just have to cut it open down the middle, wipe it clean, then we can place that flower inside.'\n'Have you obtained the inhabitants' permission?'\n'Oren dragged a batch of supplies over when he sent the commandos, and these are the scraps the inhabitants don't need anymore. Leave it to me once we're on overtime—I don't want to see you cracking it open by hand.'\n'We have at most an hour before the monastery resumes its journey.'\n'We'll make it. That reminds me, though, Federico...'\n'What is it?'\n'I don't believe that gardener left a will.'\n'Monastery resident Clément Dubois has received an appropriate burial. He did not leave behind an executable will, nor any other personal estate.'\n'Um, you know I'm trying to ask, right?'\n'You wish to understand why I am preserving this flower.'\n'This isn't your first time handling an assignment with so much baggage, right? But I've never seen you leave a keepsake for yourself before... Are you doing okay?'\n'My assignment is complete. But there as still unaddressed doubts raised by the Sanctilaminium Ambrosii.'\n'If I'm remembering correctly, there was this quote from some Saint: 'A gun needs a target, but not every question can have an answer.''\n'I cannot overlook any issues. They will directly impact any followup assignments.'\n'*sigh* What am I even worrying over? Wait, don't tell me you questioned His Holiness when you went to report the mission progress?'\n'I did, but did not receive an answer.'\n'So that's why you're insisting on giving a nearly burnt-out flower another drying. Now I get it. Still, I have to say one thing—whether you can keep it preserved or not doesn't depend much on this glass bell I'm cutting. It's already dead. It's not the flower it was before, Federico.'\n'Richele, your word count in this conversation is significantly above-average.'\n'Ahaha, just making small talk. And I'm not even going to ask where you got that average from. Alright, it's settled—after we give this a wash, we'll stick it onto the pedestal. It'll be as pretty as what they sell in stores.'\n'Thank you.' Federico takes the grimy glass bell from his coworker's hands, and walks out of the junk-filled shed.\n'Well, then. What kind of answer will you find, Laterano's newest Saint?'"
