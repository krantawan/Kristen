In other words, if Flamebringer did indeed take these lives, then his past is far more complicated than we ever imagined.

That's it. \nBut of course, it may truly be that simple. That Flamebringer treats these plants, himself, his allies, his enemies, and all living beings with the exact same, unified attitude. We must first gain an understanding of this before we can truly understand Flamebringer. \nPerhaps this is the reason Flamebringer regards both himself and his enemies so fleetingly.
