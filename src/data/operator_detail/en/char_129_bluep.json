Blue Poison feels better about Rhodes Island's diversity, and the group's open-mindedness to her abilities such that she can use them to her full potential. \nShe is more defensive on the issue of describing herself as 'toxic.' The question was if would she accept her poisonous nature if the other operators accepted her and no longer kept their distance? Blue Poison didn't give a straight answer, politely deflecting the question as usual. \nDoes she still hate her powers?

In fact, her 'poison power' manifests mostly in her skill with and knowledge of poison. \nIn her spare time, Blue Poison is interested in much more mundane variety things, such as baking. Operator Gummy, currently assigned to kitchen duty in Logistics, has claimed that Blue Poison's desserts are so good, they could 'convert someone who hates sweets!' Another unnamed Operator who has also tasted her treats echoed the sentiment that Blue Poison is proficient enough to start a bakery--if she made better choices in visual presentation. \nAside from dessert making, Blue Poison has a keen sense of and passion for fashion, having already made several suggestions about her costume to Logistics and Trade.",

These past few days, dinner hours have ended with numerous operators unwilling to leave, sitting at already cleared-out tables looking around in anticipation of that day's confections.\nAn operator who wishes to remain unnamed (and is not a Lateran) confesses to us: 'I didn't believe them at first, when they said off-menu desserts kept showing up in the canteen recently. Then last night, my very idea of desserts got completely upended.'\nWe only half-believed it ourselves when we squeezed into the dessert section and pulled out what looked like an extremely ordinary 'lemon' from amidst the cakes. Not normally eaten whole, we cut the fruit open and got the familiar lemony scent, and even saw its glistening juices flow out from the cut. However, once we tasted the tart-yet-sweet, faintly milk-flavored layers of cake that made up the 'pulp' inside, like the other operators we were blown away by the chef's ingenuity and maestro-level craft.\nWe attempted to interview the few operators that typically make their way in and out of the cafeteria kitchen, but all of them smiled and refused to answer our questions. In the end, with Operator Ceobe serving as an avenue for our breakthrough, we finally obtained enough leads to discover the maker... no, the artist of these desserts.\nWe found the operator in question at the Medical Department. She was busy at the time, and could not spare us an interview.\nAs Operator Honeyberry (who just so happened to be free) informed us, the chef has recently been busy assisting Medical with developing pharmaceuticals more appealing to children.\nA significant number of child patients are aboard Rhodes Island, and the question of how to improve their compliance in taking medication has always vexed our medics. Many children instinctively make a show of resistance when faced with liquid or tablet doses that they hate the taste of. The vast majority of Medic operators can imagine that the simple addition of sugar wouldn't rid a drug of its strange flavor.\nAs of now, though, Medical has developed several successful formulations with this operator's help. Making use of her precise grasp on flavor and color, she's not only been able to conceal the uniquely offputting taste of these drugs, but has taken full advantage of the opportunity, using these medical flavors as a base to create aromas that make your mouth water. Following strict safety tests, these preparations have been provided to the children to immediately fantastic results. According to the little patients, taking medicine on time has suddenly become something to look forward to.\n(Underneath this news article is written in small font: She didn't want us to publish this draft out of shyness, and used more desserts to bribe us to that end... I mean, we couldn't not listen to her!)",
