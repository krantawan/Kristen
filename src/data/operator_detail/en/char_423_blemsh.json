Indeed, though Miss Blemishine's personality seems much different from that of her magnanimous, upright sister, the heroic statures of the two knights on the battlefield as well as the intimacy they have in private speak to the familial love etched within their bloodline. However, perhaps due to her young age when Nearl was expelled from Kazimierz, Blemishine seems to have a deeper and more natural connection with Whislash, as opposed to the pure admiration and longing she carries for her older sister. \nBlemishine is very outgoing, quickly striking it up with most operators. She even reveals her somewhat capricious side to those she is familiar with. When it comes to formal occasions or serious conversations, however, Blemishine is more than capable of conducting herself in the same way her sister does - noble and steady, with gravitas behind each sentence. \nThough she now accompanies her sister on the front lines as a Defender Operator, protecting those who need it, Blemishine has another surprising interest. During her stay on the landship, Blemishine frequently made contact with Vulcan and Closure, and also visited other engineering enthusiasts such as Glaucus and Mayer. Reportedly, on several occasions, Blemishine wanted to ask if she could go to the Engineering Department to observe and study. Considering the prior times she was authorized and how she had gotten so engrossed with various workshops to the point of appearing MIA while being unable to extricate herself, these subsequent requests were tactfully rejected. \n'Having her around feels just like having a sister around, but her passion for craftsmanship is a little overboard. After all, I'm no Kazimierz knight, and I can't answer a lot of her questions...' —Mayer\n'Does this kid want to date an anvil or something?!' —Closure",

            "storyText": "Before joining Rhodes Island, Miss Blemishine, also known as Maria Nearl, chose to become a competition knight in order to restore her family's name. Those at Rhodes Island may perhaps be familiar with the name, Nearl, as the code name of Margaret Nearl, the Radiant Knight. However, in Kazimierz, the word 'Nearl' points to an enduring lineage of knights, a family line wreathed in boundless glory. For over a hundred years, this family has produced countless legendary knights — whether using tactical brilliance to subvert the ambitions of Leithanian nobles, or employing their outstanding talents to hold a border garrison that has never fallen. Even after the rise of the competition knights, legendary champions such as Margaret Nearl continued to defend the glory of the Nearl family — but the birth of the Radiant Knight would prove to be turning point for the Nearl family. \nThe Radiant Knight was exiled, and when the Knight Primus passed of old age, Młynar Nearl, the next in line to shoulder the burden of nobility, scoffed at Kazimierz's conception of 'nobility' and refused to become a competition knight. And thus, the Nearl family was left with no Knight Primus. Faced with constant pressure from the Knights Association, as a last resort, the youngest member of the family, Maria Nearl, went with her aunt Zofia to walk the path of a competition knight. Due to her veneration of her sister and aunt, as well as the elder knights she had known since childhood, Maria always held an idealistic view of what it meant to be a knight. Of course, Maria was clever enough to recognize her naivete, often considering whether or not there was some darker undercurrent that was not yet clear to her. But the tortuous complexity of Kazimierz's knight sports far exceeded what the young girl was capable of conceiving. \nIn her brief career as a knight, Blemishine was exposed to many things she had never witnessed before. The young Maria actually never thought too deeply about what it meant to be a knight— after all, she was acting out of consideration for her family, and was reluctantly pushed into becoming a knight out of a sense of responsibility. She took the initiative to assume both the glory and the obligations of her role, a testimony to her virtue, but perhaps because of her noble upbringing, she never seriously considered the relationship between what she saw, thought, and did. In modern society, noble sacrifices and selfless dedication are not as harrowing as they are described in literature, but Maria Nearl nevertheless embraced the simple rationale of 'seizing glory for the family' and called upon the spirit of dedication within her, becoming known as the 'unsociable competition knight.'",

            "storyText": "Kazimierz's commercialization of its ancient class of knights once invited criticism from other countries. But the birth of Kazimierz's knight sports, as well as the existence of knighthood as a whole, are more complicated than most outsiders realize. \nRoughly 120 years ago, Kazimierz's nomadic cities were far less developed than they are today. When a noble knight died without an heir, leaving behind a large swath of land, the Kazimierz National Council auctioned off his property. Specifically, the noble's castle and the mobile platform it was built upon. While this was certainly not an uncommon occurrence in Kazimierz, what made this event remarkable was the winning bidder: not a knight representing some proud noble, but rather an affinity of the deceased nobleman. A single knight-affinity had put forth a huge sum that rendered all the nobles in the room speechless. Furthermore, following notarization by the National Council, each piece of copper plate with which the affinity had purchased the land and the castle was determined to be legitimate income — the knight had handed the family business over to the affinity, who then made the business flourish. In the modern era in which countries jockey to establish connections, one can tell from a glance who has the ability to create wealth. In the following decades, the relationship between the merchant class and the affinities became more closely interconnected. The affinities were the ones who could truly create benefit for the country, able to build walls and even move city-states to defend the country. Due to the volatility between Kazimierz, Ursus, and Leithanien, as well as the intrigue among powerful nobles, the knights had to rely on extremely wealthy guards to consolidate their positions and ambitions. After decades of cruel, bloody change, Kazimierz has finally arrived where it is today. \nIf the overthrow of Kazimierz's Elder regime and the establishment of the knights as the ruling class is Kazimierz's first historical turning point, then the upending of their rule by the mercantile-affinities in a practical sense and the formation of Kazimierz's oligarchical ruling class can undoubtedly be seen as a second turning point. Even the knights and nobles who are quite critical of this development do concede that modern entrepreneurs have made outstanding contributions to Kazimierz — from the forested countryside to the towering spires of the city-states, countless people rely on Kazimierz's corporate economy for food, housing, and transportation — 'It's the economy, stupid.' \nThe current knight sports industry is the result of this bloody social upheaval — the warrior-knights guarding the frontier have all but lost their political status as 'nobles.' Instead, they became warriors directly operating under the Adeptus Sprawiedliwi Kazimierz. Any legal Kazimierz citizen, former noble knight or otherwise, has the right to participate in the knight competitions, win titles, and earn distinctions of nobility, regardless of background. This sporting event, derived from ancient knightly tests of skill, has become an inseparable part of Kazimierz's economy, politics, and culture. Nevertheless, these changes are not palatable for all knights, and undercurrents continue to surge within Kazimierz. \n'Unreasonable, you say? Everyone who found it unreasonable has been eliminated, creating this thoroughly reasonable history. Fortunately, I've accepted this truth. You understand this, don't you?' —Spokesman Malkiewicz's conversation with the Doctor during the Major",

            "storyText": "Maria herself chose to take the codename 'Blemishine.' Unlike Operator Whislash, who took on her title as a competition knight, and Operator Nearl, who adopted her family name, Blemishine discarded the shackles of her family and cast aside the intoxicating, gilded path of knighthood. Before her lies an expansive, but lonely, future. Maria understands her immaturity better than anyone else, so she has taken the name of 'Blemishine' to reflect the incompleteness of her light. \nMaria has a favorite knight novel. In the novel, the protagonist experiences bizarre adventures on the way to completing his quest, and this occupies 95% of the book. At the end of the book, the middle-aged knight, no longer needed by his family, no longer favored by the Knight Order, and no longer burdened by his love affair, decides to leave. In a distant seaside country, he once again finds his home as a knight, charging against the waves again and again until his voice becomes hoarse, and he is eventually consumed by the ocean— this abrupt ending was once lambasted by more conservative readers, and this novel is the subject of many intense discussions within the circles of Kazimierz's literary critics. Some say the novel is trash, but others consider the ending a completion of the sublimation of chivalry. \nMaria likes the novel for one simple reason - though many think the tale of puritanical, almost crazed sacrifice incompatible with Maria's personality, Maria found an answer to her own questions in the old novel penned during the early days of Kazimierz's knight sports: the meaning of meaning. \nWhile sitting alone with the Doctor and reflecting on the occurrences in Kazimierz, Maria suddenly smiled and said: 'My sister is the knight who broke the waves.' From the perspective of Maria, younger sister of the Radiant Knight, we gain a glimpse of why Nearl, who always despised knight sports, chose to become Kazimierz's Radiant Knight and why she decided to return to her homeland, only to be exiled again after defeating a powerful enemy. If we treat her pure faith as a prayer of sorts, the Radiant Knight's series of shocking behaviors may actually be the exact same as those of the ancient Wanderer Knight who went to pay homage to the ancestors in front of the grave at the Lone Mountain. \nMaria eventually decided to become her sister's protector, using her exceptional crafting talents to provide assistance to the Radiant Knight. Even Mechanist praised her augmented knight armor. She acted like a little sister when vying for Margaret's attention, and acted like a knight when receiving Zofia's training. She learned to put behind her the things that burdened her in the past. Now, she only wants to know what they, the knights of Kazimeriz, can see hand-in-hand, after the waves have washed away their lances and shields.",

Having joined a few days before Blemishine, Platinum was leaning against the wall as if waiting for her. \nWhen the eyes of the two Kazimierz operators met, even the HR personnel could feel the tension between them. But it doesn't seem like Platinum harbors any particular animus for Blemishine, and Blemishine has also made it clear that she has 'no particular hostility' towards Platinum. The fact remains that Blemishine, who normally loves to laugh, has never smiled in front of Platinum. Anyone with a discerning eye can see the distance between them. \nThe internal situation within Rhodes Island is becoming more and more complex. While we are proud of our inclusivity, improper handling of interpersonal relationships can lead to conflict. It would be strange to expect the Knight-Assassin of the Armorless Union to develop bonds with Maria Nearl, who herself had been involved in this turmoil. \nSince then, however, most of Platinum's attention seems to have been directed towards the Doctor. Though we still don't know what she wants from the Doctor and Rhodes Island, as long as she continues to maintain her current performance, she may be able to mend her relationship with a certain knight... maybe?",

He'd already made the kid's come true.\nOnce, Maria was viewing her ancestor's portraits by Margaret and Auntie Zofia's sides, listening to them tell legends of Kazimierzian knights of old. She lifted her head and asked her sister: 'Is the armor they wear the same as yours?'\nMargaret smiled and shook her head.\nThen Maria asked: 'What about the sword?'\nUnable to hold back a laugh, Zofia decided they'd pay a visit to Kowal's knight workshop while the weather was still good.\nThat afternoon, Maria saw Master Kowal hard at work in his shop. He was always a friend to his friends, and on occasion boisterous too.\n'If a knight's honor really be measured in a crown, then that crown's going to be made by the Craftsman's Guild,' Kowal laughed, as he picked Maria up.\nMaria didn't mind the smell of iron at all. She watched the delighted expressions flit across her sister and aunt's faces as they looked over the weapon, and her eyes shone brilliantly.\nLuckier still, she just so happened to be deft at the very thing she was interested in, which raised her spirits.\n'She's a jack-of-all-trades, I tell you,' Kowal said, wiping the foam from his mouth. 'Say, remember when we were holding that lone city out on the plains? Remember all that work the old one-eyed boy from the blacksmith's got up to, and we thought he was just some nobody? If it weren't for him, we'd have caved before reinforcements arrived!'\n'Of course I remember! How could I forget!' The old knight's face was aglow at the mention of tales of the past, and even his own drunkenness slipped his mind. 'But what're you saying? Maria could match that, no contest!'\nKowal would normally have fired a retort at his old friend out of habit, but as that stretch of the past washed over him, and he remembered the brothers-in-arms they'd lost, he fell quiet. His silence said enough though, and V took a swig of his drink before lowering his voice. 'What d'you think of her, that Maria girl?'\n'Me?' Kowal came back to his senses, went briefly blank, then let out a huge grin. 'If Maria'd been around back then, holding the city would've been nothing. Could've even counterattacked! And done it damn well.'\nV said nothing. He simply returned his own grin.\nFor the banished Margaret had come to mind.\nMaria had cried for days and nights, even wailing about how she'd go find her sister herself. It was Zofia who soothed her to sleep, and kept her company at home.\nKowal loathed himself for doing an awful job of protecting the Nearl family, and was ashamed of what old man Kirill might've thought. All these years, he'd hardly done any work himself.\nRust. Creeping across the surface of this radiant, beautiful city. Yet the old boys could hardly do a thing anymore.\n'I'd give anything to hear those lively sounds a-banging away again. We need that girl's hands...' Kowal mumbles to himself.\n'...Too much to drink, methinks?'\n'No, like this, you see.'\nKowal sidesteps the question and gesticulates with his hands, as if he's holding a hammer, and the scene outside the tent's a thousand miles of grassland lapping at the white clouds, and the lumber and the stones pile up high amidst the sounds of knocking, forming a grand castle.\nClank—\nRinging through the air.",

Maria can tell.\nAn unfamiliar host is straightening out their formal attire, ice-cold light shrouding the entire venue, but the night sky is a million miles away, and the superfluous bustle envelops her.\nShe turns her head, only to see expressionless campaign knights. Their silver armor appears dazzling—they nod to send her their regards. Some elderly people step up, reading out indistinct sentences. She sees the Grand Knight Russell, a hair older than everyone else, the hero in her twilight, under her ceremonial guard's escort, approaching her bearing a shield.\nMaria recognizes this shield. Engraved with the crest of the Nearls, wrapped in the banner of the Nearls, it could not be any more familiar to her. Maria knows what this signifies, and she feels a sense of bewilderment. Her uncle didn't want her becoming the Knight Primus, and her sister didn't want to acknowledge the modern knight institution. So what should she do?\nOr... what does she want to do?\nMaria hurriedly looks around. Her sister's not there. Her auntie isn't there. Uncle Młynar, V, Master Kowal, Marcin, none of them are there. She wants to run, but rationality lashes her to the spot. This is a major occasion. She can't shrink away, even if this isn't how she wanted it.\nNerves and unease momentarily catapult Maria into reminiscence. It's a workshop breathing with sizzling heat, and she's forging a brand new sword for her sister Margaret. V and Master Kowal are bickering as ever—Zofia lovingly wipes her forehead to take off the sweat, and tidies up her disheveled hair. Młynar is in the shade of a tree not far away, silently watching over it all, and on the other side of the street, long since lost to her childhood memories, are her father, mother, and the one who'd left only the shadow of a lance behind at the fringes of her hopes, old Grandpa Nearl...\n'From this day forth, you are Knight Primus of the Nearl family.'\nMaria accepts the shield, and its solitary weight leaves her lost at sea. She feels as if she's still in that vision. She's still poring over blueprints, operating the furnace. She doesn't want to forge mail to amuse the people, nor lances to slaughter the innocent.\nShe wants to forge an 'ideal.' An 'ideal' to protect the ones she loves, to become a hero's strength, to brace herself upright, never to dread confusion and solitude.\nThe clanging of steel on steel still rings in her ears. Engulfing the cheers, engulfing the glory.\n'Maria.' A familiar voice softly calls to her.\nShe lifts her head, and at this moment the clamorous arena holds not a soul in sight.",
