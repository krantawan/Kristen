Physically, mentally, in all sorts of senses... you conquer this height, you touch the sky, you prove your own worth.\nThat seems to be exactly it, yet it's not that simple.\nAt least, to Miss Ensia, it's not that simple.\nWhile in Kjerag, mountain-climbing to her was less about conquering something and more about connecting something. At the foot is her brother, Sir Enciodes, and the whole Silverash family, and atop the mountain is her sister, the Saintess of all Kjerag.\nShe's already scaled Karlan before, and whether to conquer or connect, she's succeeded.\nBut we've received word today that Miss Ensia has taken gold in a Bolívarian mountaineering event.\nAn honor she's put her life on the line for, with dangers beyond anyone's imagination.\nThe hosts' climate monitoring systems had malfunctioned, and the competitors were faced midway with a snowstorm and a series of ice cracks out of nowhere. With the vast majority having no way forward, the hosts announced the event was suspended, and organized a squad to rescue any competitors who hadn't yet returned to base camp. On top of that, Miss Ensia had lost her communications gear, insulated tent, and part of her food supply while escaping danger. In these extreme circumstances, every second longer out there was a matter of life or death, but she'd already overcome the most difficult, perilous ice ridge known to Terra, and the summit was calling. So, should she retreat, or should she turn around and continue up?\n......\nAfter Miss Ensia came to, the first thing she reportedly said to the medical personnel was this: 'The sight from the summit was amazing!'\nThe hosts proclaimed the event still valid, and gave the trophy to Miss Ensia, as the one and only award-winner.\nThe distant peaks beyond Kjerag have none of Kjeragandr's divine protection. Miss Ensia was no more than a competitor from strange parts. She succeeded in planting her flag at the very top, all just for a view of the unknown.\n......\nTo end today's special program, we leave you with a quote from the hosts' speech when they gave the award:\n'She is a true climber.'\n—Special report made on-the-spot by the network after news of Cliffheart winning a Bolívarian mountaineering event made its way back to Kjerag. Above extracts are taken from body of report."
