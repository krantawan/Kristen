When the civil war broke out, he couldn't see the difference between either side of the conflict, and so he left the country before it devolved into an all-out war, his puzzlement in tow. Ever since, he's lived incognito and has shown little to no interest in the affairs of Kazdel.\nStormeye is primarily in charge of leading a squad on his own to execute field combat operations. He has a particular penchant for the most precarious battlefields.\nHe rarely comments on Rhodes Island's overall expansion plans or its trajectory. More often, he shows up at meetings where an operation's details are being worked out. While many Sarkaz leave an impression on others due to their outstanding Originium Arts, his exceptional combat prowess stems mostly from his own extreme stubbornness in battle, his zealous study of all kinds of combat techniques, and having honed his natural-born detection Arts for years. These skills have become the perfect complement to his combat style.\nStormeye was already infected with Oripathy when he left Kazdel, but given the conditions he was living in at the time, he did not have the luxury of worrying about his illness. Judging from the growth pattern of the Originium crystals, he was likely infected for a second time during combat. During his exile across Terra, he used his might to defend the Infected's right to survive, and gradually became the leader of a small group that possessed considerable combat strength.\nEven while the civil war was in full swing, Babel had already taken notice of this young Sarkaz thanks to the close attention they paid to all the Sarkaz powers that had fled to other parts of Terra. Not long after Rhodes Island was founded, our operators found themselves in a standoff against Stormeye and his militia during an intervention in an Infected-related conflict. After the two sides talked it out, he agreed to join Rhodes Island.\nEven though Stormeye isn't one to bring up his ideals and beliefs, after he joined Rhodes Island he quickly demonstrated through his actions his strong approval for Rhodes Island's. To him, Rhodes Island is the third answer he'd been waiting for in response to the disappointment and bewilderment he'd felt during the civil war. Perhaps what he had been hoping for in that Infected community were allies who truly believed the Infected should live just like anybody else.",
