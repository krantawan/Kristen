            "storyText": "Because of its unique properties, Engineering has added an addendum regarding Wiš'adel's new weapon (despite the fact that she has never registered a single weapon with us). It reads as follows:\nIf we analyzed only structure and functionality, Wiš'adel's 'new weapon' is a primary artillery-level witchcraft amplification unit. In perfect condition, its power could far exceed our control, especially when wielded by Wiš'adel. Fortunately, this unit seems to have received severe damage. Frankly, I don't understand why she's even carrying that piece of junk around. To throw at people, maybe? From what I've heard, there's no way she'd be that gentle.\n(The above contents have been redacted)\nThe following was written by Closure, Chief Engineer of the Engineering Department, Closure:\nThe guy who registered Wiš'adel's weapon last time is gonna be busy rebuilding the testing grounds from scratch for the foreseeable future. There's been loads of horror stories about Wiš'adel going around the ship, but she's basically the kind of girl who always brings you way more trouble than you could ever imagine. Well, what can you do? It's not easy for non-Sarkaz operators to wrap their heads around what exactly she's carrying. It's not as simple as a 'new weapon.' That's an honest-to-god revenant possessing the thing, and the same one that possessed the airship that appeared above Londinium, to boot. So, the plain fact is that we have some crazy old Sarkaz ancestor following her around and touring Rhodes Island. He hasn't been shy about calling the younger generation a bunch of wusses either. Still, the 'ancestral blabber inhibitor' Wiš'adel requested is on our R&D to-do list. We've run into a bit of a technological bottleneck, but... all of Engineering's Sarkaz members are giving this project their 120%.\nAlso, while we're still cleaning up the mess at the testing grounds, almost all of Engineering's explosives experts have been coming uninvited to try and recreate the whole process of the explosion in front of the remnants of whatever got blown to pieces. The guys in charge of the testing grounds weren't idiots, either. Before Wiš'adel even set foot inside, we strictly limited the amount of explosives she's allowed to carry. Even then, with the help of the revenant's witchcraft, the damage she caused still far exceeded our expectations. The most experienced explosives expert in all of Engineering told me you could only blow up such a wide area with this little explosive material 'in theory.' He gave me two possible explanations. One: that her brain could figure out the most precise blast calculations in a split-second—which would make her a super genius—or two: that she could make bombs out of thin air. After a round of discussion, they were apparently leaning towards the latter, and even handed Kal'tsit a proposal based on this principle, suggesting that we let Wiš'adel create an unlimited amount of explosives for us. Of course, Kal'tsit rejected it on the spot.\n\nWhat, you're saying making bombs out of thin air goes against the laws of physics? Just think about it, though. Isn't that way more plausible than W— I mean, Wiš'adel, being a mathematical genius?\n—A certain Engineering Department explosives expert",

Also found within were several crude drawings resembling maps. As these notes were often accompanied by drawings of skulls and explosions, Rhodes Island's Security Department made the decision to investigate the matter and invited Hoederer and Ines to assist.\nInes quickly flipped through the notebook before giving a smile of unclear significance and refusing to provide any further assistance. Finally, at Security's insistence, Hoederer explained to us the contents of the notebook:\nPlan No. 1, confirmed the positions of the directional explosives on the Shard's underground structural layer. Expected to blow the whole building and bury Theresis in one go. Explosives needed: Lots and lots. Can we just take over Theresis's munitions factories? Still wouldn't be enough. Plan abandoned.\nPlan No. 2, setting explosives at key points inside the Shard. Theresis's always hanging out at the top, so we blow it in half and let him fall to his death. Explosives needed: Lots, maybe actually doable though. Plan abandoned. Couldn't get inside the Shard.\nPlan No. 3, bring a bunch of drones, drop a bomb on his ass when he's taking in the view on the balcony. Explosives needed: One super big one. Will ask Closure later when I see her.\nPlan No. 4....\nHoederer points out that the next dozen pages are all pretty similar in content, but each plan has a slightly different course of action and manner in which the explosives are placed and set off. Ignoring the vulgar language directed at Theresis, most of the proposals are at least theoretically possible. Hoederer further told Security that the notes later go into dozens of plans to strike the Military Commission's camp, hundreds of ways to plant the explosives, and some other random things.\nAfter making a number of contingencies against attacks on the Doctor included in the notes, Security determined that the notebook posed no further threat and turned it over to Hoederer to be returned to its owner. However, he refused.\n\n'To think she practiced signing her name as Wiš'adel for dozens of pages.'\n'Heh, I wonder where she picked up the habit of jotting everything down.'\n—Hallway conversation",

Of course, this is just a facade, Doctor. She is more Sarkaz than most Sarkaz, and cruelty and insanity are etched into her bones. Unlike the little lamb with her, she'd never talk reason.\nI saw no few people like her around Her Highness. At the time, aside from her outstanding combat prowess, there was nothing special about her. Even after she left Babel and swore to avenge Her Highness in Her Highness's name, I took her to be driven by a fury brewed from her emotions.\nYou saw what happened afterward.\nW was too clear-headed, to the point that even Her Highness's return could not bring her down. Rather than delusional venting, her search has proven to be a series of carefully laid-out, rational plans.\nWhile she will never be able to set aside her hatred, she will no doubt do everything in her power to assimilate and make use of the Military Commission's legacy. For the same reasons, I doubt she will do anything to you, either. After all, she has long been confident that she has learned the truth, and she understands you and Rhodes Island's irreplaceable place in her plans for the future.\nI've met a number of mercenaries who have followed her for some time. None were from Babel, and she's never told them about Babel's ideals. It certainly makes sense: some things will only sound like a lie when told to others. But just by blowing open the steel walls before them and marching forward, those mercenaries' eyes have grown brighter and brighter.\nMy belief is that she did in fact show others the light she once saw.\nA crazed mercenary who's killed so many becoming Her Highness's successor, the next Chairman of Babel? Ridiculous, right? But this is Kazdel. When you look at it that way, it's hardly absurd.\n—■■■\n\n'The Djall's gone? Not bad. Look at the direction she's heading. Perfect for checking how safe this building is—'\nA familiar Sarkaz appears at the end of the hallway. After a few seconds of silence, a dull noise comes, and she finally cracks a smile, satisfied.\n'So, it's just you and me now, <i>Doctor</i>.

Not only did the actions of her and her squad save the lives of countless of soldiers and preserve the forces needed to rebuild Kazdel, they also laid the foundations for the Kazdel Babel government's relationship with the Core countries such as Victoria a few years down the road.\nAs for Wiš'adel herself—\nSurely everyone in attendance must be familiar with her?

After all, those who never learned to all drowned in it.\nAs she grew up a little, she began to enjoy using fire to dismember the dark night.

But as soon as the dust settled, there was nothing but silence and death.\nAfterward—\nMany Sarkaz have speculated that Wiš'adel loves the sunrise in Kazdel more than anything else.\nOn windless days, she always visits a small, unassuming shop before dawn to laze about until breakfast before going home.

His body is badly worn down, one leg longer than the other, and a piece of his pauldrons missing to reveal a dark, empty interior.\nHis sword has also shattered, seemingly broken when wielded towards one of his own kind. He had been hiding in a windmill, begging for him to wait for sundown before striking. That way, all the children playing inside his body would have already gone home. He agreed. Two or three hours meant nothing to beings such as them. He sat on a hillside until the sun went down, then returned and slew the whooshing windmill.\nGhosts dwelling in the depths of an ancient tower, books buried beneath the ruins of the Great Library, an unmanned pirate ship, a scale that measures the weight of lives... He remembers his promise to the King of Sarkaz, the reason for his travels: to bring his scattered kind back to Kazdel, and he would be the very last.\nBut what is this endless golden expanse before his eyes? A desert, an ocean, or one of infinite Kazdels?\nThe suit of armor is sinking. The delineation between body and sand blurs, just as he can no longer distinguish between what he thinks and what is true. When the sand completely covers his head, he will disappear for good.\n'Tap, tap tap.' \nA tapping sound comes from the top of his head.\nPerhaps it is just a fowlbeast hoping to find food in the bits of grass growing there.\n'Clang—clang—'\nThe sand entombing him begins to shift.\nNo, it is not the sand that is moving. Someone is kicking him. From the sound of things, someone is treating him—the eldest revenant, the first guardian of Kazdel, chief advisor to all Kings of Sarkaz—as a ball to be punted around.\n'You—'\n'Can you hear me? If you can, then stop playing dead. I've been lugging you around for so long, you'd better start pulling your weight. Otherwise, I'll pawn you off as scrap metal when I get back!' \n'...What do you want?'\n'Whoa, you've sure mellowed out. Back when you had that big ol' body, didn't your vocabulary consisted mostly of words like 'hatred', 'flee', and 'wretched outbloods'? I was worried for a sec that you were even more illiterate than me and those were the only words you knew.\n'To think Her Highness chose someone so crass...'\n'Now that's what I'm talking about. But no rush to get back to your old self. Time to get to work.'\n'Doing what exac—?'\nBefore he could finish, he was already up in the air.\n'Is that enough? Or do I need to throw in more explosives?'\nHe is flying.\nFlying high, high above the dunes, over the ruins, until—\nKazdel.\nA place he thought he would never see again.\nWith the way he's going, he'll soon crash into the meeting hall of the former Royal Court, the place where he once made a promise to King Yliš using all the remaining soulflame of his people—\n'Wiš'adel, *Sarkaz cursing*—!\n'Haha, that eager to curse yourself, o venerated ancestor?' The young Sarkaz laughs mirthfully. 'Go on then. Use that rage, blow everything up, and once you've gotten rid of all that junk, I'll take you home.'",
