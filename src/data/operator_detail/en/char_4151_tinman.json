The latest trends in Columbia quickly find their way to his desk.

At least, that's what they told me, because I had no idea what happened. All I know is that I lost all my senses: sight, hearing, touch... even the sense of pain.\nYou might think it's for the better that I couldn't feel pain, but without your senses, you're a soul trapped in a prison, with nothing but numb silence and darkness... nothing but solitude.\nI tried to think about something, anything, to fight the terror, but it's like falling into a bottomless pit... there's no foundation on which to even think. You just keep falling, falling...\nYou can't imagine the relief I felt when I finally heard someone ask me a question. I would have gladly revealed the name of my crush, if not for Logos' incantation.\n—An Anonymous Operator\n\nBesides his Originium Arts, Tin Man is accompanied by three 'friends' who also have bodies of metal. The hot dog is Larry, the donut is Curly, and the hamburger is Mo. They are always noisy and often get into trouble, but are surprisingly reliable when it comes to helping with Tin Man's work.\n\nYeah, like the time they tried to switch the tiles when we were teaching him how to play mahjong.\n—Kroos\n\nHe has even sat down with the three of them to play four-man mahjong.\nDon't treat them as Tin Man's subordinates, or they'll follow you everywhere, Big Larry crying in your left ear with his thick bass voice, Ol' Curly muttering incessantly in your right, and Lil' Mo trying to throw a lasso over your neck. Not to choke you, mind you, but enough to make you feel like you have cervical spondylosis.\n—Lava\n\n[Classified Log]\nLike someone learning to talk again after being mute for many years, they're just learning to 'live' in their own way.\nIf you want to see another side of them, go find them when Tin Man is performing maintenance on his exoskeleton.

That's accurate, at least.'\n'That's what they all say!' The pioneer laughs, and the campfire quivers to the laughter. 'But this is the future, and the future is no fairy tale.
