There was also a rumor that she 'likes to doodle on her clothes'. However, the operators know that the intricate embroidery and patterns on her royal garments are definitely not doodles.\nMany have remarked that Vina has become more laid-back and carefree after coming to Rhodes Island.\nHow about the claim that she is 'a picky eater who hates potatoes'? This was disproven after she was seen, on several occasions, chowing down on the nutritious meals provided by Hibiscus. The assertion that she is 'low energy and sluggish' was also quickly debunked. According to our operators, Vina actively takes part in many activities at Rhodes Island, including postpartum care for burdenbeasts and test-driving Engineering's new tractor.\nWhat should we make of the changes in Vina Victoria's lifestyle? That's still being looked into. However, it is clear that many of the personal details leaked by the Glasgow Gang and recorded in Vina's file were simply pranks and should be removed.\n\nPranks?! If you remove anything, you're boneheads! You hear me, HR, official boneheads! I'll fight every single one of you!—Indra\nVina once said she liked sour lollipops because the intense sourness made her feel more alive. It's probably the same reason I enjoy the awful, nearly expired sauce from Old Hank's shop.\nAs for the claw marks she draws on her clothes, she said it's to let the ingrates see at a glance what kind of marks she can leave on them.\nAs for her hating potatoes, that part's true, but it also shows her determination and resolve. She even dragged Hannah into the boxing ring once, to get her to eat all her potatoes for her.\nAnd the reason she can fall asleep anywhere is because she's always exhausted. I get that—if I had to be two people at once, I'd be tired too.\nThat's the Vina I know, and no one can tell me otherwise! These new 'records' you're adding are nothing but lies.\n\n—Morgan\nBut whenever we see her, she's the same old Vina. She still shoves her potatoes onto Hannah's plate like always.\n—Dagda\n\nHold on, Dagda, that isn't contradictory. While I no longer dislike potatoes, it's still funny to put them on Hannah's plate... But Mr. Recordkeeper sir, everything Morgan said is completely true as well! I've even fallen off the tram while dozing off...\nTch, never mind, why am I bothering to explain this? Anyway, those are all things I've done, so just leave them in my file!\n—When the Glasgow Gang caused a ruckus at HR, Vina attempted to mediate.",

            "storyText": "The Holy Orb of Order, a symbol of the Victorian parliamentary system, is usually held by the Speaker (the King themself). It is made of a special alloy crafted by royal alchemists; its deep blue hue emits a mysterious, shifting glow when placed in the light. It is adorned with a golden band in the center, set with various dark gemstones. There are two different Holy Orbs of Order: one engraved with a red dragon, and the other with a lion. The former belongs to the Draco royal family, and the latter belongs to the Aslan royal family. Eventually, the orb with the red dragon disappeared along with the Draco royal bloodline, while the orb with the lion has been passed down through the Aslan royal family for generations.\n\nProfessor Briggs, 65 years old, and a faculty member at Victorian National University, tearfully recounted his experience. According to him, the current Speaker of Parliament, Vina Victoria, unexpectedly approached him one sunny afternoon, seeking information on the Holy Orb of Order. After Professor Briggs carefully explained the orb's history and political significance, as well as the process used to make it, the Speaker revealed her true purpose: she wanted to repurpose it into a voting bell to remind members to attend votes punctually! She even planned to make replicas and distribute them to every MP!\nProfessor Briggs deeply regretted not asking for clarification in the beginning. He tried to 'hypnotize' the Speaker with his words, hoping she would forget this absurd idea as well as what he had told her, but unsurprisingly, he failed. In his despair, he cried that a royal heirloom, the sacred symbol of Parliament, should never be desecrated like this—and if it were, it certainly would not be in relation to him.\nThe Speaker, however, had a different perspective. She boldly asserted that since both the Holy Orb and the voting bell are used to maintain parliamentary order, they are clearly the same thing.\n—'Londinium Bi-Monthly,' Headline News, 'Parliamentary Relic or Gold-Plated Alarm Clock?'\n\nYour Grace, we are losing Victoria.\nThe Duke of Wellington's stance is clear, and his will is firm. We have no way to respond by force, lest we provoke another war. While Tara's economy is imbalanced, its foundation remains strong. You would need to collaborate even more closely than you currently do with the other dukes if you want to put economic pressure on the Duke of Wellington.\nOn the other side, only Alexandrina and Parliament remain. As you said, there is no need to rush in and get involved; rather than seizing authority, Alexandrina seems to be building her own power base in a land where previous sources of authority have already been shattered. The power she is accumulating... we could have harvested it.\nHowever, as I've mentioned several times in my reports, her methods are unconventional. She appears adept at dismantling established symbols of power. Though she is currently powerless against the crown, the Holy Orb of Order has already been reduced to what common folk jokingly call a 'gold-plated alarm clock.'\nI don't know how she plans to establish her authority after so eagerly dismantling the existing symbols of power. I believe her approach will lead to one of two outcomes: either she will quickly be hanged by her own people, or she will create a kind of power we've never seen before and can't ever hope to harness.\n—Report submitted to the Duke of Caster, intercepted by Operator Harmonie and secretly forwarded to Rhodes Island\n\nHa, it's happening all over again. I pass some bills in Parliament, and they remain indifferent... but when that little orb is placed on the lathe, everyone gets so worked up.\nWhen all else fails, shake things up! That still works in politics, from time to time.\n—After reading the above report, Vina laughed.",

            "storyText": "This one? This is a photo that the Count of Schutzbury gave me. Don't worry about who he is for now... Can you guess what it's of?\nRight, it's just a blurry mess, I can't make it out either. The day he gave it to me, he didn't prattle on about his usual theories of justice. Instead, he looked at this blurry photo and went on and on about what he saw in it: a bakery with a red sign, selling the worst bread on the block. Yet, homeless people would gather in front of it every night, eating the leftover bread the owner had left out. There was a sunken area on the road in front of the shop, where water would collect every time it rained. The neighborhood children would pick up the bread wrappers thrown away by the adults and fold them into paper boats to float in the water, etc...\nI later found out that his unusual behavior was something Vina had orchestrated.\nStrange, isn't it? Morgan and the others told me that Vina used to be like all the other street thugs—she despised nobles to her core. Two months ago, I would have had a hard time imagining her speaking with any noble for ten minutes without throwing a punch. In the past two months, she's made more new noble friends than I've made new intelligence contacts. Of course, she still hates salons, fancy dinners, and balls, but at least she's willing to let a viscount talk about his family's ancestral beliefs before raising her fist, or let a scholar explain some new, emerging political theories, or let an army officer recount the social ills he's witnessed firsthand. Just like how she used to listen to me talk all night about Lynncardine. It seems like she is trying to understand the Victoria she's determined to shatter.\nVictoria is dirty, but it's also proud. Over a thousand years ago, when the Draco people were still nomadic tribal leaders, they pieced together the earliest form of Victoria using a framework borrowed from Sargon. But the fundamental source of their power was still their ability to protect their people—something they took pride in. That pride has been passed down, stumbling along the way, to the present day. Every noble child still blindly recites 'Honor her glory, shield and protector,' just as their ancestors did, though they no longer can see the people they need to protect.\nI think Vina must have seen that pride, which is why she's holding back her fist for now. She wants these people to open their eyes and see Victoria the way she does. So, while riding in Count Schutzbury's hot air balloon, Vina pressed his head down, making him look at the streets below, showing him that the people he treated like trash also had lives of their own. What he couldn't see, Vina described to him, street by street, until the sky began to lighten again, until the hot air balloon was frosted over.\nAfter they came down, Count Schutzbury immediately called back those poor souls he had thrown into the boiler room without any protective gear. He started telling everyone about the sights he saw, the things he had learned for the very first time. Of course... we all know this was probably just momentary self-reflection. Vina opened his eyes, but in the end, he will most likely close them again.\nBut even so, for Victoria, this is a big deal.\n—A conversation between Delphine and the Doctor",

      "desc": "Vina never expected her meeting with the Doctor after reboarding to take so long.\nWhen she strolled through the Command Center doors on a whim, she never would have guessed the intense discussions the Doctor and Closure were having was about a board game of all things. Londinium's newest fad—The Adventure of the Lioness. There were only so many ways to kill time in the pubs right now, and this game for kids quickly found a home among pubgoers who loved picking at politics.\nTo all that, the Doctor replied: 'Closure and I see plenty of unpatched holes in the game design.'\nShe prepared to deploy her standard suite of excuse-mes and beat a hasty retreat, but Closure had already sealed off her escape route, and was urging her to join in. 'I can vouch. This game really takes me back to those days, you know? Underground in Londinium, fighting with the Self-Salvation Corps.'\nAnd how was she to predict that a fun little idea from a couple of kids playing house would get snapped up, commercialized, shipped, and become all the rage in Londinium? And then the greatest surprise was Morgan gleefully bringing the game back to the landship and recommending it to everyone she possibly could.\n'I'll play as you.' Taking on the 'Vina' role, the Doctor readied for the other two players' assault. Dice rolled again and again, and each time City Keeper 'Vina' came out on top, even twice succeeding in a complete counteroffensive and taking the 'Caster' territory for 'herself'.\nDefeated time and time again by 'herself', Vina was somewhat exasperated. 'Doctor, this is cheating. Hardly anything you're doing is in the rulebook.'\n'We never agreed to play by anyone else's rules, Vina.\n'Londinium's an enormous city. There are plenty to draw on that the designers didn't know or care about. That's what I meant by holes.'\nFor a moment, Vina thought to herself, then threw herself decisively into the next round. The aftermath of an independent Tara, the strategic give-and-take of Caster, the Infected vanguard bearing news of Gododdin... Vina played character after character, trying with all her might to wrest the Doctor's advantage away, but always to minimal effect.\nBefore her eyes was a city that far surpassed her expectations. With a peculiar and twisted ambition, she sought to beat 'herself'.\nBut it was beyond her to read any of the strange and crafty angles by which the Doctor defused her offensives. Their tiny little board couldn't support the three's game anymore. With a flash of inspiration, Closure called directly on PRTS to simulate one that was even larger and more complex.\n'Uh. Closure, are you allowed to use PRTS like that? What if Dr. Kal'tsit—'\nClosure waved it off. 'She's got urgent business, she's not on the ship. Besides, I have the permissions to guarantee she'll never find out what we did.'\nAn absurdly protracted ten hours later, Vina finally had to excuse herself from the game thanks to an anonymous express delivery to her dormitory.\nWhat had arrived was the yet-to-be-published first expansion for the game, including a series of all-new powers with all-new game plays. There was Normandy, Ashworth, and the Unicorn. Printed on the box was a roadmap for future expansions and updates, too.\n'The Adeptus Chamber Knights, the Empire's Blades, the Agents of Operation Boulder, the Twins' Voices, and the Angels of Judgement...'\nAnd finally, a message that left Vina silent.\n'I hope you like it! Looking forward to your feedback. —Eleanor'",
