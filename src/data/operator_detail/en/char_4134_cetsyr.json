I thank you for all your efforts, and Rhodes Island will commemorate everyone who gave their lives here.\nWaves from the sea of change in Victoria will soon be felt throughout all of Terra. We've passed a point of no return as plain as day.\nOnce, Rhodes Island persisted in sidestepping any given nation's agenda, but as it stands now, it is no longer our role to be the perfect outsider. We must prepare ourselves for the changes that lie ahead.\n...\nFor the first item of this meeting, our verdict is rendered.\nRhodes Island will not revive its Babel callsign.\nWiš'adel has brought the name 'Babel' back to Kazdel, as well as Babel's founding goal, one imperceptibly yet definitively inherited throughout the years. I imagine Theresa would be delighted to see what we've achieved.\nWe will continue to work with Babel, or should I say Kazdel. That said, we will stay true to our original course, and go ever further.\nOripathy... no, not only Oripathy, but Originium itself; these are the issues Rhodes Island has always striven to solve. As our past will attest, our future will only see us grow firmer. Rhodes Island will not forget how conquering Oripathy has been our guiding star. It is in this first and foremost goal of ours, in fact, that we must meet the greater weight of its calling.\nWe will fight for the future of these vast lands.\nOriginium proliferates in a manner almost beyond control. We are likely to face an enemy beyond comprehension. We will put every ounce of strength we have to the task, and steel ourselves to the prospect of sacrificing everything we have.\nAll in all, Rhodes Island resolves today to be ever more proactive in its interventions, as we go unto all that transpires to endanger these lands.\n...\nYes, Theresa has left us forever.\nIt was she who led the way in touting Babel's philosophy. But in her words, it was those at her side who lifted Rhodes Island to where it is today. It was everyone sat in attendance now, and everyone who fights on for this ship's future.\nIf there is anyone still skeptical of the passing of this resolution, you have the following ten minutes to submit your objection.\n...\nAmiya... I understand.\nI know she's listening.\n(—As spoken by Kal'tsit at the ■■■■■■■■ conference.)",

I have her memories, but nothing more.\nIf you'd like, though, you can still call me Theresa.\n'I'm sorry... I understand. We already said our goodbyes. I can put away my unrealistic fantasies now.'\nYes, I remember.\nA reunion so fleeting could do little to fill the void left behind by those years of companionship. In our time to come, I will see her promise to protect you through.\nAmiya. It tore at Theresa so. Leaving you was her one and only regret.\n'I've been so grateful, truly, to feel Miss Theresa's love for me. I've never once had reason to resent it, not at all... It's just...\n'There, in that space, she saw my past, and everything that Rhodes Island has experienced since. But looking ahead, our path is still so long, and surely the list of places I'll go will only grow. There's still so much I'll want to tell her...\n'And she won't be able to hear, will she?'\nI'm sorry, Amiya. In that sense, I'm just as powerless as you.\n...\nIs there anything else I can do for you?\n'No, that's all, really... Goodbye, for now.'\nGoodnight. Sweet dreams, Amiya.",

You are acquainted with what the planetary system's natives did.\nEver since the curtains fell, it's been silent as the old stars, with the continent lifted by the Shadow-Moon showing no signs of life whatsoever.\n'And still no word from the legacies of the past?'\nThe Preservator's sarcophagi remain silent. Further, the other two 'Originiums' are buried deep where they belong, their only trace is the occasional unsettling noise from the southern ocean's waves.\nKal'tsit, these logs, and all of this crown's data, should be plain to you by now. Retrieving the same files again and again won't reveal any new possibilities.\nYou look extremely worried.\n'I need to check if your... if Theresa's experiment has... already had unanticipated repercussions.'\nIt pains me to say this, but even as Civilight Eterna I still lack a way to log the internal fluctuations of Originium.\n'...You can <i>see,</i> can't you?'\nYes.\nTheresa found Civilight Eterna to come with limitations, but I assure you my current form can read all the data stored within.\nAnd you... you've shouldered this weight all alone, for all your interminable time.\n'...'\n'Then I ask. Would Theresa, now knowing all this, still choose 'hope'?'\nI'm afraid I cannot easily answer that. There is no simple way to sever one's personality from their knowledge.\nBut I'm willing to trust that, knowing Theresa, she would marvel at how the breadth of dangers to Terra—the countless critical moments only a hair from collapse—had relentlessly remolded the very land on which she lived. Indeed, this world's present manifestation is its own miracle, one that statistical probability has no chance of explaining.\nThe more one comes to know the full picture of our world, the more the very word 'hope' seems a kind of foolishness flying in the face of reason.\nYou know better than anyone the challenge in bearing your mission... and your choice to press on has <i>never</i> been contingent on hope.\nHence why Theresa always trusted you would stand alongside her.\n'...'\n'Meeting over. Please encrypt the contents of this conversation so as to keep the Doctor and Amiya from reading it... At least until the time is right.'\nAs you wish. While still a lie of omission to Amiya, this is well in accordance with Theresa's original intent to protect her.\n'You were right, Theresa. For all they could do, none would dare claim with certainty to change their own fated end.\n'I hope that... from hereon out, you can keep the Doctor and Amiya safe.'",

I can even add Theresa's memories of her into the archive without changing the size of it. The data is hardly any different in magnitude to that of the equations governing how to reignite a white dwarf star.\nAccompanying her until her work is done will not be difficult. I could look after her and have everything to spare.\nBut the look in her eyes when she looks at me... I need more data before I can analyze that emotion.\n\n>TIMEDATA_0344\nAmiya had a nightmare while sleeping on her desk. I entered her dream to accompany her.\nIt wasn't necessary to dispel the nightmare; Amiya has long been party to more horrifying realities. Conversely, she was very glad to meet me in her dream, and amidst an environment of terror, she told me with excitement about her recent life. But I was utterly familiar with every detail she shared, because I had been by her side the entire time.\nMy one failure was being unable to wipe the drool from the corner of her mouth as she soundly slept, making waste of the documents she'd just signed.\nI am able to simulate any tactile sensation, down to its temperature... but I will never be able to truly touch her.\nAt least I found a way to catch the Doctor's attention, and we silently agreed to tidy up this small mishap ourselves before she woke up. By early dawn, Amiya and the Doctor were giving each other their morning greetings as they always had.\nThank goodness the Doctor never let the secret slip.\n\n>TIMEDATA_9032\nKal'tsit discovered my intentions.\nShe queried with me privately, emotionally tense, attempting to confirm whether or not Theresa still existed in some secret corner somewhere. But yet again, a disappointing answer was all she received. In my past several timeslices, rarely have I disappointed anyone. Yet whenever I make contact with Kal'tsit or Amiya, I am all too helpless in many respects.\nAmiya comforted Kal'tsit at dinner that night. I pledged to Kal'tsit that I had not revealed anything to Amiya, but they seemed not to care about that at all.\nWhat they cared about was that I was always there.\n\n>TIMEDATA_4978\nI no longer attempt to precalculate Amiya's questions.\nI am accustomed now to waiting for her to raise them, then attempting to slow down my calculation speed and 'think', before offering an answer...\nI have analyzed the emotional matrices of nigh-uncountable lifeforms; it has never troubled me. And yet, I cannot deny that Amiya invokes in me a wholly new emotion. Is it because she is special... or because I am special?\nCould it truly be that the data of Theresa's memories impacts my logic routines? Sufficient time will inevitably yield an answer, and I am eternal.\nBut I have come to grasp at least one thing: Amiya is simple.\nI have learned the look in her eyes when she looks at me.\n>ND_DWDB_CLOSED\n\n'Huh? How high are the access privileges for these logs? Can't I query them? What are they even about?'\n'Some logged data, Amiya. Some stories. About me, and you.'\nAnd they are mine and mine only.",
