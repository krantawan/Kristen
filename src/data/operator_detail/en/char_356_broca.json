As far as anyone can tell, he has completely integrated as a member of Rhodes Island.\nThough every new recruit to Rhodes Island agrees with our core philosophy and, as of right now, our ranks consist mostly of new members added over the last two years, few have truly come to regard Rhodes Island as 'home.' Of course, we do not require this of all our Operators. In principle, we do not mind becoming a springboard for our Operators, provided that they do not damage the interests of Rhodes Island in the process. However, because many of the old soldiers who truly loved Rhodes Island have been taken away by the flames of wars past, we do have a need to cultivate the next generation of those who can become our bedrock.\nOf course, this means that Rhodes Island will have to live up to its tenets, or do even better.

In a shadowy corner sits a loud-mouthed man.\n'Signore, you got any bros?'\nHearing him utter that specific word, 'bros,' the gentiluomo haughtily pulls at his sleeve collars, and speaks boastfully.\n'My elder brother Davis, Signore Davis to you, is an important man in the Eastern region. He has many a means up his sleeve. I won't be loitering in here for long.'\n'Nice, nice. I've got a buddy too. Bet you he's also trying every trick to get me out.'\n'My brother has a lawyer who charges four thousand an hour. What does your 'bro' have?'\n'A giant drill? Plus some insanely buff arms. No joke, chiseled like a rock.'\n'Oh? And how is he going to rescue you from this place? Punching a hole in the wall?'\n'Haha, yeah, that's just his style.'\nLetting out a disdainful sneer, the gentiluomo folds his arms and silently mocks this man in his head—\n'Doesn't he know the walls here are half a meter of cement? What an utter dunce.'\nThe door creaks open, and in comes a man carrying paperwork, his leather shoes gleaming unusually brightly in the dim of the cell.\n'Signore Hengel, my pleasure. I'm your brother's attorney.'\nThe gentiluomo pats off his suit and gingerly stands.\n'Are you here to let me out?'\n'Sincere apologies, Signore Hengel, but I cannot.\n'Your brother wanted me to deliver you a message: 'Enjoying the benefits of the famiglia comes with a duty to the famiglia.''\nAt these words, the gentiluomo's eyes grow wide.\n'But it was my brother who had me do those things...'\nYet the lawyer gives him not even another glance, merely a parting remark as he turns to leave.\n'Brothers must help each other out, no, signore?'\n'Stop, wait, come back! You bastard!'\nThe gentiluomo clutches at the bars and begins to wail. The man in the corner attempts, at least, to comfort him.\n'Maybe you can come with us.'\n'Pull your head out. Your 'bro' isn't coming.\n'Everyone who lands in here, without exception, is someone their famiglia cast away.'\n'...Famiglia? It ain't anything like that. He's a buddy to me. He'll come.'\n'Enough, you moron. Even setting aside how heavy the guard is out there, this wall alone is fifty whole—'\nAn earsplitting drilling noise cuts off the gentiluomo mid-sentence. Through the wall steadily pokes out a gargantuan drill, wrecking the concrete at such speed it may as well be shredded paper.\nDust and debris is thrown down in spades, and the ground itself lightly trembles.\nA burly man steps through the yawning hole, toting the giant drill by hand. The light shining in from behind him hides his face in chiaroscuro.\nCasually turning off his handheld titan, the man turns to ask something to the dumbstruck gentiluomo.\n'Are you coming with us, signore?'"
