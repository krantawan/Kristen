She doesn't come from any age-old knight family, and she's far from any gifted knight prodigy. Flametail Knight used to just be the Zalak girl Sona, no more than an ordinary Kazimierzian living in a Zalak settlement. It was one day when a Catastrophe changed the course of Sona's life, owing to the Kaliska knight family's neglect of their few subjects, leading to the destruction of Sona's home. Her family, friends and once peaceful life vanished like mist in a single night. The young Zalak girl wasn't strong enough to accept the truth straight away—and despite her past being far out of sight these days, every time her home and her past are mentioned, the conversation-loving, ever cheerily smiling Sona's mood always, unconsciously, halts for just a moment. And we have no idea how Sona, that helpless Zalak, made it out of the disaster. We only know that by the time Pinus Sylvestris's other members came to know her, Sona was already the way she is today, as if she's never changed.\n'I can tell something's hanging between the two of them, but the past comes up from time to time the and I never hear much more than, well, Greynuty's old knight family failed Sona and whatever.' —Wild Mane\n'Of course Sona's not as strong as you people think.

This plantlife on the verge of extinction nowadays was once an emblem of magnificence, beauty and tenacity.\nAfter leaving her hometown, Flametail lived in a booming commercial city for a time, eking out a living on the lowest rung. Unexpectedly, however, that city became part of the Kawalerielki Alliance, and through this, Flametail learned of another way out—Infected knighthood. It wasn't long at this time since Flametail had caught Oripathy, and she'd never gone through any training related to knight competitions, but she really didn't have all that many choices for a living.\nAt the start, independent knight Sona was thrown into a cage filled with vicious beasts and traps, and after that came an artificial jungle, and a sealed-off skyscraper. Sona realized what the Infected experienced was a world of difference to the immaculate, bright competition knights on TV—they were all voluntarily spectated playthings, and their own lives practically became the one worth they held.\nWhat definitively changed Sona actually was an official knight competition. Knight vs. knight, Infected vs. Infected. But whether Sona herself, or the Pinus Sylvestris members we talked with afterwards, no one would touch on what everyone went through during that period. However, what we can be sure of is that that blood sport of Infected knights thoroughly changed her. In the moment she held her riches and 'Flametail' title from the Knights Association high, the seed was planted in Sona's heart, waiting to root and bud.",

Pinus Sylvestris Knightclub used all the wealth they earned from knight competitions to house Infected—but in the course of things, Infected numbers began to exceed what Sona imagined. At first, she just wanted to try to unite the Infected knights, to find survival in the ruthless wipe out qualifiers. After they found their footing, they became aware of an enormous amount of Infected existing in poverty in the Grand Knight Territory, with no means to become knights, forced to live in the city's sub-levels. And the first to decide, to know she would help every Infected she could, was Flametail Knight Sona.\nShe didn't take long to go from founding Pinus Sylvestris Knightclub to rescuing the Infected of Kawalerielki. No speeches to stir the heart, no carefully detailed plan, it was practically by chance that Sona led the Infected knights to see today. She didn't come to Rhodes Island just for herself and Pinus Sylvestris's knights either. More than that, it was a hope that the vulnerable Infected they guided could seek Rhodes Island's treatment.\nThough the Infected experience in Kawalerielki is complex, the Adeptus Sprawiedliwi and General Chamber of Commerce remain in constant friction to this day. The city's neon shades and loud crowds have imperceptibly led people to accept a fact—knights are no longer what they used to be. The people have forgotten what glory the knights once stood for. And despite Sona never having truly treated herself as a knight, and never stressing any point of glory or justice, she undoubtedly, wholly fits the part of that romantic imagination of knights.\n'Sona is a true knight. It gladdens me that in the Kazimierz of now, I could still meet a fellow companion like her.' —Nearl",

If they hadn't been infected, forced to take this path, perhaps Pinus Sylvestris's people would all be living some other life in Kazimierz.\nFlametail's intermittent appearances on the landship aren't marked just by the core of Infected knights; her smile, cheerful attitude, and nature of pressing forward when running into difficulty involuntarily draw in everyone surrounding. Quite a number of Kazimierz-born operators even head for the Grand Knight Territory of their own accord thanks to Sona, and though it's led to her joking along the lines of 'Wait, is this Knightclub poaching talent from Rhodes Island now?', Flametail's leaderly charm as a knight of Kazimierz is clear to see.\nOf course, Flametail has admitted herself that there are three knights she's come to respect from the heart after getting to know them a little. The Radiant Knight, a.k.a. our Nearl, certainly holds a place, and as for who the other two are, Flametail Knight has left us on a cliffhanger.",

Silently, Fartooth follows her too. Wild Mane, just as ever, wants her to give a direction to charge in.\nSeemingly since it started, Sona has been the one most lacking a reason for standing on the frontline.\nBut of course she doesn't really 'lack reason.' No one who lacks faith can, under a city grinding humanity away, put up a struggle to that degree.\nExceedingly few people simply realize—like our Radiant Knight, Nearl does—that some people are born with a mind for devotion and a consciousness of sacrifice, that some are innately able to fight for a grand, distant goal.\nAnd this goal, and Rhodes Island's, are presently highly identical.\nIn future? In future, well... the present Land of the Knights is a mile from the 'Knights' already. Just what its future will be, by all appearances, isn't much to do with us.\n—■■■",

And maybe, some time next year, the pinecones that fell intact would find a completely new life in the ash-blanketed earth... just as she did.\nShe had to live on, in the stead of her friends and family who lost their lives to Catastrophe. She had to plant roots and bud in the soil they named Kazimierz. Such notions kept her driven to the present day.\nBut before she knew it, Sona was shaking her head free of them all. They skipped too many steps—they would only trap her in more regrettable circumstances. She couldn't go on like this. She had to learn to be optimistic. Shape up her act, and perhaps the merchants would give her an out, and employ this little Infected girl to do what handiwork she could.\nSoon after, she learned from newspapers and television that Infected, too, could be knights. She was going to find a way in. Still, she wanted to become one just so she could make a living. With no chivalric spirit of old turned life lesson, and no grand visions or hopes, Sona clenched her fist tight.\nBut the next thing she knew, she was being forced to raise it against fellow Infected who deserved it just as little.\nSona wasn't strong, but she was nimble. She stood out amongst the Infected for it, and was selected by the bankroller of an underground power and sent into the 'cleaning qualifiers.' No weapon in hand, danger surrounding her, and a single fist planted in her foe's face. And they toppled, and Sona won the right to survive another day—but she wasn't happy. She wasn't strong. Taking her opponent down in one blow... it could only be because they were starving, because the evening before, their backer 'tipped' a few knights some bonds to get into a brawl with them.\nSona wasn't happy. She wasn't strong.\nSome fawned, telling her if she just dressed up a little, she'd be so cute, so lovely and sweet. Some gushed, telling her if she just went through some proper training, she'd be a terror of the racetrack.\nUntil one voice told her: 'You've got a tail like a blazing fire.' It caught her off guard.\nThere was nothing in particular beneath that statement, and it was no more than an ordinary spectator, reveling in the violence, who yelled it.\nBut it was the first time Sona had ever choked with emotion after a match.\nYes. She'd just realized it. She ought to be like a blazing fire.",
