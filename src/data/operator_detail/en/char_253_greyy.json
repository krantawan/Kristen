It has a nice sheen, the parts are brand new, and there's no rust or signs of wear whatsoever.\nThis is the first time that he's really owned something that's completely his, something so shiny from top to bottom. There is so much that Greyy wants to say welling up in his chest, but he's unable to muster even a single word.\nThat morning, the staff at Medical smiled as they handed him some documents to take to the Doctor's office.\nWhen he arrived with the big stack of papers, he ended up with a surprise present.\nHe hasn't had the time to process why he received this present, though—perhaps it's just psychological. He certainly feels his abilities still have much room for improvement, even if the staff he's been using is more than enough for all the Arts he knows.\nUnable to contain his excitement, he runs all the way up to the deck. The sky is so blue. The breeze blows past his hair, seeping into his throat.\nGreyy goes over everything he learned in his head. His buffs up his cheeks. His hands aren't trembling the slightest, even when he's holding onto the staff.\nThe Arts he learned from both his mother and the Rhodes Island instructors, as well as the knowledge he picked up while tending to the power facilities. He'll repay all this kindness in his own way—\nFrom freezing cold to blazing heat.\nFrom darkness to blinding light.\nHe gazes even further than his eyes can see, towards home.\nEven though he can't see any part of his homeland right now, he can feel the fragrance of it yet lingering in his nostrils. He even remembers how the abandoned Originium chunks felt when he touched them as a kid.\nHis light can now reach many more places, but the times when he sat with his father and mother in front of that small lamp are still some of the brightest memories he has.\nWhen the voltage of a staff's Arts Unit increases in an instant, the surge of the electric charges may as well be a reflection of the Caster's state of mind—From a state of disorder to one of order, they surge toward a common destination, in the end gathering in one spot and releasing a brilliant glow.\nOn the deck, the winds blowing from all directions brush his hair. With how vividly brilliant the sometimes introverted, timid boy looks this very moment, it's as though he himself, and not the staff, is letting out that radiant glow."
