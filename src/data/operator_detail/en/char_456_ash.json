After examination, we were able to locate structural defects in those areas. Miss Cohen then assisted Rhodes Island operators in rectifying and repairing these defects. As Engineering operators supervised the repair process, they soon found that while they were still discussing the repair process, Miss Cohen was already putting theory into practice. While this likely was due to her existing knowledge in engineering and structural systems, perhaps more important is her experience in applying this knowledge to high-intensity situations. The solutions she comes up with are certainly not flawless, but her plans always carry minimum risk and are implementable with ease.\nOn top of that, she always prefers to take on the most dangerous tasks herself.",

Any mistake she makes under her command can put the whole team in grave, irreversible peril. This is something she has come to understand very well after her recent deployments.\nTherefore, in addition to making improvements to the way she commands, she has also started to rely more on her teammates' abilities: Frost's attention to detail, Tachanka's ability to keep calm, and Blitz's optimism.

The other guys had to take apart Mr. Alexsandr's weapon for analysis and then put something new together. It's a lot easier and much less aggravating to just spend less money on something off the shelf. Ahem, I digress. There weren't a lot of adjustments we had to make on Miss Cohen's weapon. All we had to do was modify it to use Originium rounds, or so I thought, but Miss Cohen was pretty particular about her ammunition.\nShe wanted rounds that not only stuck to the surface, but could then bore through it before blowing up? And without using Originium Arts? Just what were these things she's been using? She said she didn't know the exact procedures to recreate them, but she could share some of the know-how behind it. That sounds wonderful!\nWith Miss Cohen's help, we were able to create a prototype of the type of rounds she described. The process wasn't really a walk in the park, but it turned out pretty well! The only thing is... the whole process behind making these rounds is far too complicated, and so we couldn't use them as regular ammunition. In the end, we ended up taking a step back and made her weapon compatible with normal projectiles instead.\n\nIn conclusion, it's a lot more convenient to just use Originium Arts.",

The toughest battle he ever endured... was just a match in a Kazimierz arena.\nIs he really qualified for this job?\nWhy would a Columbian recruit a group of warriors from all across the world?\nJust as these thoughts run through his mind, someone pushes open the door.\nA tall, red-haired lady wearing sunglasses walks in.\nShe has a small gun hanging from her waist, but she is not a Sankta.\nShe walks up to the podium, clearly in no hurry.\n\n'Welcome to my squad.'\n'You can call me Ash.'"

Are you talking about County York? That's a city in Victoria.'\n'In other words, Victoria has a County York, but Columbia doesn’t have a New York??'\n'That's right.'\n\nThe soldier falls silent again, muttering something along the lines of 'this makes no sense.'\nThumbtack recalls an incident last week at the cafeteria, when Ash was shocked to see blue tomatoes and square potatoes.\nMost of the operators were visibly perplexed.\nJust what kind of country do they come from?\n\n'Now that I think about it...'\nThumbtack decides to change the topic.\n'When we get a day off this week, the folks from Engineering are going to play football on the deck. Want to watch?'\n'Football... what exactly is that?'\n'Have you never seen a football game before? 11 players on each side, and they try to kick a ball into the other team’s goal.'\n'Oh! Yeah, I know that one.'\nFor a moment, the expression on Ash’s face becomes much softer.\n\nThat's something comforting to her?\nThumbtack remains at a loss.\n"
