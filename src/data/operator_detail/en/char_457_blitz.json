Evaluating solely from a combat perspective, Blitz excels in close-range physical altercations and firefights, having been assessed via multiple simulations in street and indoor settings and receiving comparatively formidable scores. Based on this, we can speculate that Blitz was already an expert at handling urban incidents prior to his arrival at Rhodes Island.\nBlitz is adept at grasping the small and subtle nuances of language, and within no time at all since arriving at Rhodes Island, we observed him able to fluently communicate with others.\nEach member of Team Rainbow brings to the table their own set of specialized skills. That said, given they have not formalized any long-term contract with Rhodes Island, it would be advised not to call on them for too many missions.",

His conduct during combat, vigorous and unparalyzed by fear of survival, only serves to affirm this.\nDue to the similarities between their armaments, there are frequent discussions between Blitz and Liskarm.

This is why, following the 'Watchtower 33' incident, he has begun laser-focusing on learning the combat techniques here, as well as helping to develop countermeasures.

Major upgrades were improvements to its material composition and work done on its flash installation.\nThe upgrade process itself went smoothly. The Engineering Department had six or seven different materials at their disposal which would fit Blitz's requirements. All he had to do was make the choice and we got it done instantly for him.\nAs for the flash installation, knowing Blitz is unable to use Originium Arts, I went for a traditional method, converting stun grenades into ammunition and mounting that to the shield's fittings. Give it a pull, it flashes off, boom.\nBut I did still install a high-power Originium Spotlight model as well. Miss Closure pitched in to help design the accompanying energizer module for it, and no, we didn't suddenly forget Blitz couldn't use Originium Arts. It's part of why we adopted a modular approach to the whole installation's assembly. Makes it so you only need to work by parts to run kit maintenance and repairs on the whole thing. Up there as the most complicated bit of Originium equipment I've worked on this whole year. Only drawback is... the parts are kinda expensive. Operator Blitz's gonna need to deal with that one himself.\n\nHonestly, I wonder if I should apply for a patent for this design...",

That there's a land in the wastes for these refugees to eke out a living?'\nThe mercenaries' worries weren't without reason, Kötz understands that.\nBut he has no grounds to doubt that young Leithanian noble. The self-professed Hyacinth Count's Arts have saved countless people in the midst of war, and he claims he can lead these people to a new home.\nSuch kindness is hard to come by.\nKötz turns to look back at the procession of refugees.\nLeithanians, Siracusans, and those driven from their homelands by conflict, now exiles of the wastes.\nThe despairing crowd trudges slow on the barren ground. Their destination, a land that exists only in legend.\n\nAnd far in the distance, a colossal glut of buildings appears on the horizon before them.\nWhen the procession reaches its destination, the people let out a collective sigh at the sight.\nAmidst a swathe of ruins, a number of constructs tower, goliaths near a hundred meters each, their sensational metal structures sheltering from the setting sun.\nYet Kötz lapses into silence.\nThe lofty metal monoliths strike no sense of wonder in him. In his own world, such buildings stood on every corner. Only their dimensions speak to a difference.\nThe colossal parabola of the antenna dish is riddled with holes, its pedestal imposing firm and straight in its root upon the earth. The wastes' bitter winds bore through those holes, giving rise to a terrifying whistle.\nUnder these ancient buildings, the low mumble of machinery still sounds, the impression cast that some equipment remains at work.\nThis radio telescope of such preposterous size is clearly not of this age.\n'So this is that land where the titans sound...'\n'Do you see that big bowl that's fallen over there?'\nThe Hyacinth Count points far off at another telescope, collapsed in disrepair.\nIts parabolic antenna, size encapsulated in tens of meters, lays turned over on the ground, forming a sturdy shelter.\n'Quite a number could fit in there.'\n'There's a spring nearby, and according to recent records, there's been very few Catastrophes in the area.'\n'So, why has nobody settled down here?'\n'Because they fear this place.'\nWith a discontented chuckle, the young Count explains.\n'Sargonians think these buildings are the remnants of a long-gone disaster.'\n'Minoans believe this place is cursed.'\n'But as a scientist, I have no faith in any of this unfounded hearsay.'\nThe refugees turn through the building's remains, finding in the age-old ruins a place of respite.\nThis is to be their new home.\n\nNight falls and Kötz sits alone, high on the ancient building, gazing at the complex, each part of it just as foregone.\nWhat went into the making of these vestiges, such that they persist from innumerable years to this very day?\nThe people of this world once looked with hope to the starry skies, but what was it that happened afterward?\nHe looks across the wastes stretching from near to far.\nEven further off, the twin moons gently rise.\n"
