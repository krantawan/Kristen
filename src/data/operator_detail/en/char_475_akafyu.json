Besides ale and grub, we, too, like to hang out and game after training! Action games improve your ability to react as a commander. Don't you know that? What? How do I play games when I can barely see? What is that supposed to mean? I can see fine!

As the illegitimate child of a noble, she was entrusted to and raised in a shrine. She was considered to be a stubborn, unruly child as she rarely obeyed any instructions. As such, she was often punished. When she was five, she met an elder from her family and was subsequently taken in by her. Under her care, she began to receive training in swordsmanship and military tactics, slowly becoming a formidable military leader. For all this time, she has never forgotten who her blood father was, but there was only ever one family member whom she trusted and one master whom she followed.\nOut of consideration that Akafuyu is unwilling to have anything more to do with her blood father, his surname will remain redacted in this record.",

During the conflict, there was a general in service of the Mitsumoto faction of the Southern Court who, unhappy with her brother, the family head, stirring up a new civil conflict, chose to defect to the north and thus helping bring this conflict to a fast conclusion. Though there was a truce, it did not mean there was an everlasting peace. In the twenty years since, the two courts found themselves in frequent clashes, and the flames of war raged incessantly. In particular, the defected general was the target of multiple assassination attempts by the south. This general is Akafuyu's aunt and also the master she serves.\nFor years, Akafuyu led a squadron that has braved through hell and high water on the battlefield until she had a close brush with death when she found herself fallen into the enemy's trap. Although she emerged unscathed, as the commander, she was exiled by the Northern Court for the failure. She left Higashi behind and eventually found her way to Rhodes Island.\nDespite being exiled by the only master she has ever trusted, Akafuyu had no complaints about the punishment she received. She still firmly believes that she will one day return to Higashi to show her master how far she has come and to fight and bring an end to the war for her master's ideals.\nWhat Akafuyu doesn't know, however, is that, contrary to her belief, it was no mere coincidence that she received an invitation to Rhodes Island. As per the client's request, this record shall remain hidden from the operator's eyes.\n\nAdditional remark: Owing to the above, direct, one-on-one contact between Akafuyu and operator Shirayuki should be kept to a minimum.",

Akafuyu doesn't turn around, but simply removes a shoulder guard with one hand and tosses it to Kirara. Her eyesight may be poor, but she's so aware of her surroundings, she might as well have a camera in her back.\n'This armor...'\n'It's an heirloom. It's not valuable. My master doesn't go out to fight much, so it was bequeathed to me.'\n'Um, the design...'\n'It's a very special shape to the armor. In the old days, each family had its own style.'\nKirara touches the shoulder guard and compares it to the armor in her game. She starts to think the developers must know of Akafuyu.\n'Someone asked me almost the same question before, a little girl about your age. She would ask me under her breath, 'Captain, is your armor made of some high-tech material? Can it really withstand a grenade blast?' Ha, she might have thought I was some antique.'\n'So, can it?'\n'Don't be a fool. It's hard, sure, but it's just a piece of metal. You'd do better training hard and listening to your commander. She knew that, of course. Still, this armor has saved me plenty of times. Look, the pit that jumps right out at you there, that crossbow bolt almost pierced clean through my arm. Oh, and she was there in the last battle, standing next to me. Damned near died.'\nKirara suddenly loses interest in the topic.\nThe heavy feeling on her knees reminds her that this shoulder guard is supposed to be unique, representing an era of glory passed from one generation to the next, still thick with the stench of war and sacrifice.\nBut now, it's a rare item in a popular game, and any player can get it, if they pay enough.\nAkafuyu stands up. Kirara decides to hurry over and take out the freshly purchased game disc before Akafuyu notices.\n'By the way, do you have a minute?' Akafuyu walks towards her, 'I just killed the final boss without taking any damage. Can you upload the recording to that forum you like? Oh, and put my name on it, so you-know-who doesn't miss it...'\nKirara only now notices the game on the screen. The main character is holding a wooden sword with the lowest ATK, wearing almost no armor, except... the piece currently resting on her knees.\n'Does it... bother you?'\n'What? Oh, that it's my armor? If someday the people of Higashi know it from a game, rather then from a battlefield... then it can only mean that the war is finally over.' Akafuyu takes back the shoulder guard and slots it neatly into place, 'I've waited too long for that day.'"
