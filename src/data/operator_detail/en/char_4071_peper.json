In other words, this girl and the Sarkaz mercenaries she brought with her were guided to us.\nWith her childish appearance, not many see her as a full-fledged mercenary. At most, she's like a girl scout. She's too young, too inexperienced, and doesn't think most things through. A kid like her should never have been fighting a war in Londinium—Most operators who've met her share this opinion.\nAnd that is indeed the case.\nWhile working with her mercenary team in Columbia, Paprika took on only minor duties such as serving as a bodyguard or slaying wild beasts. When her team leader, Grimm, heeded Theresis's call and told everyone they were heading to Londinium, she did not even understand what this new contract entailed.\nTrusting in her captain, the Sarkaz girl ignorantly marched into Londinium and followed the orders of the higher-ups. This lasted until she was brought back to the barracks by Manfred and soon saw for herself what war was really like.",

Thus, she was raised by her grandmother in a small town in Columbia.\nThe town was several hours away by car from the nearest nomadic city, and a large number of Pioneers and Infected gathered in the area. Although life was hardly luxurious, she nonetheless enjoyed a happy, stable childhood thanks to the hand-knitted items her grandmother sold for a living.\nLike most Sarkaz, Paprika became infected with Oripathy at a young age. According to her, on her tenth birthday she woke up, rubbed her eyes, and stood in front of her chipped mirror to find a small rock having emerged from her chest.\nShe immediately understood that she was already Infected.\nThe Sarkaz girl's condition was fairly stable most of the time, and she's had no critical flare-ups. To the Sarkaz, Oripathy infection is almost a foregone conclusion, so becoming Infected is hardly a major disruption to their lives. When a company, facility, or city already rejects the Sarkaz, it doesn't matter to them whether the one they're refusing entry to is also infected or not.\nAfter her infection was confirmed, Paprika's path to adulthood became more or less set in stone:\nHer grades at school were only average, so she had no opportunity to continue her education. The school she was enrolled in encouraged her to drop out, and no other would accept her.\nUnable to attend school anymore, she at first helped her grandmother with her knitting business. Then she followed the local Pioneers and started slaying wild beasts out in the barrenlands for money. In the process, she came into contact with a team of Sarkaz mercenaries, and after spending some time with them chose to join them as well.\nAfter all, other than becoming a mercenary, what choice did a Sarkaz like her have?",

Why did so many Sarkaz participate in the war when they didn't even have a reason to fight? Why did they have to choose to either kill or be killed on the battlefield?\nAre death and parting really so common to mercenaries that there's nothing to be so sad about, like what Old Grimm told her?\nPaprika still hasn't found concrete answers to many of her questions.\nHowever, every time she stares down at the old cigarette box in her hands, she thinks back to that night in the Columbian wilderness, when the mercenary team had set up a tent and a campfire. Old Grimm sat next to the fire. The exposed areas of the old Sarkaz man's body were covered in scars, and every time his lips twitched, the look on his face would scare the pants off any normal folks in the vicinity. Nonetheless, he would always give the freshest roasted jerky to the team's youngest girl, and downplayed it like he wasn't taking care of the youngsters.\nWhen he talked about the good life awaiting the Sarkaz just around the corner, even the scars on his old face stretched as he grinned.\nSadly, luck wasn't on Old Grimm's side. Soon enough, he gave his life in Victoria. When she was detained by Manfred, Paprika held onto the cigarette box she got from the old man and tried her hardest to imagine the good life that he looked forward to so much.\nWhat would that life be like? Would they never catch Oripathy again? Or would they get to pay less money each year and not be rejected for 'insufficient qualifications' when applying for school or work, simply because they're Sarkaz?\n'I used to think being a mercenary was great. We put our skills to use to make a living.'\nThat's what Operator Paprika told our other mercenary operators.\n'But they said I wasn't a full-fledged mercenary. They told me I hadn't even killed.\n'Then I finally figured it out and made sure of it.\n'It doesn't matter what grand objectives Manfred and the men above him have, at the very least, following a bastard like him and becoming a 'full-fledged mercenary' who kills without blinking an eye is not the kind of life I want to live!'",
