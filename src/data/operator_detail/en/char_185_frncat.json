They seem to leave footprints in the corridor, deliberately announcing their presence with their elegant paws.

It's just that lately my hands have been...'\n'C'mon, don't be shy now; I wasn't talking about your hands. I meant these.'\nBefore Mousse realizes it, a half-knitted pair of fingerless gloves has appeared on Haze's hands.\n'Paw pad gloves, hm? Bit of a fashion statement, don't you think? Especially for you. Oh, but don't get me wrong—they look cute on you. You gonna wear them to field training?'\nMousse hesitates, gauging Haze's reaction. Seeing the genuine approval on her face, she nods.\n'I heard that field training involves a lot of hands-on exercises where they call up the operators to demonstrate. There's no way I'd be able to hide my hands. So I thought, instead of keeping them hidden behind my back, I should make them look less intimidating. See, uh, with these soft, fluffy gloves, they don't look nearly as scary.'\n'...You still hate your hands that much, huh. Guess I was right to bring this then. Take your time reading it. Later.'\n'This is—huh?! Haze, you brought me a battle report? And now you're just walking away?'\nThe report Haze brought details a combat mission Mousse had been assigned to. The vehicle she was riding in was ambushed and set ablaze. All the operators inside were trapped behind a jammed door, unable to escape. With no time to think, Mousse used her mutated hands to tear an opening, allowing everyone to get out safely. Because of that, she had been encouraged to apply for field operator training.\nMousse looks at the combat report again. At first, she can't help but look at her 'terrifying' hands. However, her focus gradually shifts to the operators in the vehicle. She thinks about how they worked together and how she had felt at that moment—so overwhelmed she had nearly cried. She looks down at her hands, lost in thought.\n'Welcome, everyone, to basic field operator training. First, let's meet our newest recruit. Mousse, come up and introduce yourself!'\nMousse hesitantly steps onto the stage, keeping her hands behind her back as she looks out at the other operators.\n'Hello... everyone.'\nShe takes a deep breath, then slowly raises her hands in greeting. All eyes turn to her hands, and the gloves she's wearing. The gloves look fluffy, but her sharp black claws, meticulously polished, are peeking out of them, even more prominent than before.\n'I hope my hands can become a force that protects everyone.' Her voice is quiet, but firm."
