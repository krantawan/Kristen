His picks are able to unlock all sorts of complicated mechanical locks. However, since he takes his work extremely seriously, he dislikes people interfering when he's doing specialized tasks. The love and care he shows for his lockpicks puts all of Engineering to shame.\nChilchuck spends a lot of his day-to-day life helping out operators stuck in a pickle, like helping people locked out of their dorms. Though the first time he faced down Rhodes Island's security systems, he found his lockpicks were of nearly no use. Operators on scene described his expression as 'extremely adorable'.\n\nDo <i>not</i> let Rope near Chilchuck! We can't let her learn how to pick locks better from him!—A nervous Logistics operator",

The plants it's comprised of are similar to the 'tentacles' and 'Man-eating plants' of the dungeon, which are capable of disguising themselves as normal plants. It hides among the trees of the forest and the underbrush. It's unknown why, but the local wildlife can recognize them and keep their distance, even giving sympathetic glances to men who have found themselves bound and strung upside-down by the feet. This tends to make the victims angrier than they already are.\nIts fruit is aromatic and delicious, and makes a good stuffing for pies. (not recommended to approach one solely for culinary purposes.)\n[Thorned Treasure Chest]\nMostly seen in the sands of Sargon. Similar to the Mimics in the dungeon. They contain random amounts of unclaimed property, which can be exchanged for goods on the black market. Opening one will trigger its counterattack. If you're careless, you'll get stabbed. Don't take them lightly without a Medic on hand. You also shouldn't poke at them if you have the sort of companion who will snidely say 'And now you know that hiding things from your buddies will just lead to suffering'.\n[Chest Seaborn]\nThese things can transform! When they're in chest form, they'll use their tentacles to wrap around their prey and drag them inside. The suckers on their tentacles are really strong. If they latch onto your skin and you somehow manage to pull them off, the marks it leaves will last for nearly a week. Pretty embarrassing.\nThe part that looks like a chest is just as tasty as the rest of it, same taste and texture really. You can also use it as a serving tray.\n\nLet us once again thank Chilchuck for these notes, and express our sympathy for his unfortunate encounters.",

This question has lingered in the minds of every operator he has worked with.\nWhen an operator's been locked out of their room and needs help, he'll say 'good, another paycheck for me.' He will also often say 'awesome', 'sweet', etc etc, all accompanied by an inappropriate smirk...\nThese brief outbursts have caused confusion in many operators, and have led those in charge of field missions to suspect there might have been some sort of issue with the mission arrangements. If not, why would he use such 'subtly aggressive' language?\nAfter carefully poring over the mission records, we noticed that Chilchuck is actually very enthusiastic about participating in missions which involve terrain data collection or trap detection. After completing one of these missions, he will spontaneously submit a report regarding trap construction and such to Engineering. He's even posted his daily schedule up on the notice board, all to make it easier for operators who need his help to find him. It's clear how much he cares for everyone!\nLuckily, the operators have gradually learned that he's not actually complaining about them. He just has an unorthodox way of expressing himself. All that's left is to wonder when he'll finally admit that he actually cares a lot about his teammates and the other operators.",

The reason is simple: Chestnut, Durin, or even Minimalist have around twenty centimeters on him. Moreover, he has a babyface, which makes it harder to believe he is an adult.\nOnce they learn that he's actually twenty-nine years old, most are shocked into silence, mentally making sure to add a 'Mister' in front of his name. What's even more shocking is learning from Marcille that not only is he married, he has three daughters who are already old enough to be independent.\nLately, the operator who most commonly asks Chilchuck out for drinks is Harold. It is unknown when this development occurred. On occasion, Hellagur will be spotted joining them, and they can be heard saying things like 'It's been a while since I saw my three daughters. I should bring them a souvenir.', 'This photo of her I keep in my pocketwatch is from when she was but a child. Isn't she cute?', as well as 'You both have such loving and understanding daughters. I don't suppose you'd know a way to get mine to accept my letters?' And so on. Many operators feel hard to join their conversations, but for whatever reason, Vulcan and Enforcer have also joined their merry band.\nPerhaps you need to be worrying about some little kid to take part.",

Out of perfectionism, R&D into a bow that must be both light and powerful while accounting for an archer who cannot use Originium Arts was put on the schedule. It seems they even added a simple Originium cannon and lockpick set to the bow's design?\nWhatever it ends up as, you can look forward to the day Chilchuck uses this all-rounder bow.",

Apparently the Liquor Association had an accident at the hangar yesterday.'\n'Don't need to hear it, I was there! They made a worse ruckus than last time. Three cheers once more to the poor old Terran Society For The Protection of Durin People!'\n'Last time some idiot gave an automaton a champagne bubble bath and hit a control chip, right? What happened this time?'\n'Ale.'\n'Really? It's the booze again?'\n'Have you been to their hangar? They keep their entire stockpile of booze there, emphasis on the pile. Barrels and bottles all over. I'd be suspicious if nothing went wrong!'\n'Too true. And they never learn! It was a nightmare to subdue the Spirit of Liquor last time! Well, what about this time?'\n'The Association wanted to rein it in themselves, so they threw every engineer they had at it... and they're all proudly hospitalized now.'\n'Brutal... So they had to call for help again?'\n'Funny luck, actually. The moment they made the call, an expert came to them and solved it.'\n'Expert? Go on?'\n'Foreigner, complete stranger, 'bout a head shorter than you. Says he's some kinda specialist at disarming mechanical traps. At first, everyone thought he was an engineer from somewhere else, but no, he made it clear he's not. Claims he's an adventurer, just gathering supplies nearby before heading back to some dungeon. The Association thought he was drunk off his rocker, but hey, let him have a go if he wants, right? So they shake hands, and the moment they let go he's vanished into the hangar. Next thing you know, he's working his magic like a pro.'\n'Hold on, Spirit of Liquor's a deathtrap, sure, but it's not like a trap-trap, is it?'\n'Suppose it's all the same if you're good enough. By the time I got there, the hangar was back out of lockdown. He'd disassembled the machine so thoroughly, the place was a sea of parts.'\n'Trust them to get a dab hand like him—Wait, that means the problem's been solved, right? So why haven't I seen anyone from the Association all day?'\n'Problem solved meant the Association compensated him from their stash of ale like they agreed on. But you know how they are when they find someone who truly appreciates the brew. They threw a grand feast and made the foreigner their honored guest.'\n'...And?'\n'You wouldn't believe the liver on that foreigner. The little quarter-pint drank the entire Association under the table!'"
