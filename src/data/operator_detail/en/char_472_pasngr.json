Even so, he was still able to independently develop an effective mechanical device, realizing a variety of self-propelled weapons with impressive energy output.\nWhen asked about his technology, Passenger does not shy away from the topic. It is a prototype from some experimental excavation in Columbia, which researchers believe has to do with ancient Sarkaz witchcraft. They appear to have used a rare form of Arts to enrich Originium, with several enriched crystals marking the perimeter. A Columbian institute involved in the project anticipated a breakthrough to a whole new energy source and went to work quickly. Passenger did not reveal what happened next. \nBut it is worth noting that many engineering operators like to give names and other personifying features to their creations, while others distinguish them with numerical designations. But this operator does not so treat his machinery. His usage borders on the wasteful, scrapping them without hesitation after a single test. Does he have no heart?",

He has the skills, as well as the wealth, and brought with him a stable source of supplies and mercenary, Messenger, and caravan contacts, legal and otherwise, in the Ibut region.\nThis too, is good. But he's provided this all essentially free of charge! Free! Do you know what that means? It's unsettling!\nThe engineering operators say he's nothing near a ferociously dedicated machinist, even with incredible technical skill... Not only that, but he has little interest in the plight of the Infected. His room is suspiciously immaculate, neat to the point that he may have some pathology. Likewise, he has a tendency to tinker with parts of the room, scattering metal shavings across the floor. Baffling. \nBy the way, the only device he ever named was a special energy charging device he calls 'Thorne.' \nOh, I'm babbling on again, forgive me for this potentially rude question... \nWhat is it this man cares for?

But this Elliot, a young research assistant of Columbian origin, spent decades transforming himself into a man of Sargon. He has cultivated contacts, wealth, and power in the Ibut region. His unique black market brought local nobles and foreign businessmen alike into his orbit. And after getting his revenge, all that he built over twenty years, he simply discarded.\nA black marketeer, starting as a lowly assistant, rose to prominence, and gave it all up in an instant. He could have lived like the Lord Ameer of Ibut after getting his revenge. This has some in HR worried about Elliot's intentions after changing his name and coming to Rhodes Island.\nWhen pressed on this point, Elliot, Operator Passenger himself, shot a hole through our doubts.

But after meeting a target from the Engineering Department or returning victorious from a mission, there is no emotional change in his eyes at all.\nHe does not keep secrets, except for the most crucial ones. He describes his experiences and current situation clearly and concisely to anyone who asks, as if he has the speech memorized. Not everyone can face his past with such an attitude. After the fire that brought his revenge to completion, he felt relief, but what was to come next? Where does he go after leaving behind the golden sands of Sargon?\nPassenger once described Dr. Kal'tsit as his savior. Though I never saw a hint of gratitude in his trademark smile as he said it. He clearly trusts Dr. Kal'tsit on some level, and if Kal'tsit never said another word about how they met in Sargon, he would never share anything personal about her.\nAs for Sesa, Passenger is dangerously concerned with Sesa. Only a very few people, including the Doctor, know that Sesa is investigating a certain Columbian military contractor. Unfortunately, Sesa's 'incomplete revenge' fits all the elements of Passenger's attention. He is even eager to help Sesa piece together the truth. If it were not for the limitations placed on Rhodes Island Operators, it is hard to imagine what Sesa and Passenger might be able to exact on that Columbian corporation.\nThe main reason why Passenger has not acted more rashly thus far is the Doctor. No matter what his feelings toward the Doctor may be, his primary interest seems to be in actions and accomplishments. He may feel some kinship with the Doctor over their unique life experiences, or he may find comfort in having a commander to give him orders and direction. Either way, we will watch this development carefully.\nAs he said, he left Columbia, he left Sargon, and now he is at Rhodes Island. Wherever he is in the world, he is but a passengerâ€”an outsider, along for the ride.",

Three hours? Five? The golden sands rush through my clothes, tempest throwing the dust against my face, without reprieve, so rough against my eyes I have to keep them shut. But we can't stop yetâ€”the Sarkaz mercenaries behind us are still fast on our tailâ€”they're trained and tirelessâ€”even a sandstorm couldn't hold their march back. \nAnd the water... might have been drunk dry long ago. \nI've heard traditions that in the desert, filling empty canteens with sand can give people hope, but right now, I've drunk enough sand. Waterâ€”I just want one gulp of water. Even if it costs every coin of mine in exchange, I would do it. \nBut in these wilds, the shine of metal has no meaning at all. \nClutching this silver case tight, I grit my teeth and keep striding. \nMy ears are battered with mournful screams. Like the deceased are howling, and ghosts are calling. Maybe Professor Thorne is among them, calling my name? \nBut I can't quite make it out. \nHow long has my brain spent filled with these noises now? Three minutes? Three hours? Or three years? \nThe dust has blocked the sky out, day and night all the same now, time practically stood still, and only the people seeking to survive through all this still endure through this welter of punishment. \nI just wanted to research, I just wanted to offer my strength to the furtherment of science. I didn't want thisâ€”desiccating away in this sea of sandsâ€”not like this. \nMy head aches and swells and stings, my body seemingly gone long without any sense. Am I walking, or am I watching this body named Elliot squirm? \nNo... thinking too has become too much to ask. Only one thing wanders in my head, a single order: move. \nMove... move... move... \n...but the desert is limitless. \n'Elliot, open your mouth.' \nOpen my mouth? \nI subconsciously slacken my muscles, let my lips and teeth reveal the channel to my oral cavity. \nA fruit coated in sand and soil lands in my mouth. \nAcrid? And sweet? Oh, it's water. It's water. \nIt's water. \n...... \nSince when, I don't know, but there's no more wind at my ears, the land has returned to peace, and there's only sun, sand, and two earthly humans walking through the dunes. \n...... \nI gaze off far. Beyond the yellow dust, is still more yellow dust. \nNo end is in sight, just like technical documentation scattered all across the ground to be trodden by wet leather shoes, no longer able to be reassembled, nor made sense of. \nIn anger, I kick at the sand, and watch it tumble and slide down the dune, then blend again into the desert, as if nothing ever happened. \nSand, sand. \nI begin to hate sand for the first time in my entire life. \n'Let's go. We'll be able to replenish supplies very soon.' \nKal'tsit interrupts my train of thought. \nUm, very soon? How soon can it be? \nAnd resupply? How much could that be? \nButâ€”Kal'tsit never promises hope to anyone. \nBut at least... \nI think I can see a cactus.",

      "desc": "The Reefsteep Black Market, where I was born anew.\nAt the end of the western passage, one can see the land and the sky. Once, it was an arms dealer's territory. I worked under him in my first few years in this place. He was a born despot. He left several welts on my back, but I've no hate for him. It was only natural, just as it was only natural that his irate underlings slit his throat in drunkenness, before throwing him from a cliff. I placed my first gold coin in those turncoats' hands, and it was warm to the touch.\nThe northern oasis, Reefsteep's border. For a time and an age, the favored turf of the mercenaries. Soldiers were replaced batch by batch, but there was only ever one leader. My biggest customer, and the one who taught me how to taste wine. But that winter, he died. He died in front of my storehouse, his body bruised and battered. He coveted my creations, and died to my precautions. Mercenaries keep no loyalty, and thus I rewarded his subordinates at his funeral. Unfortunately, his life couldn't even buy a decent bottle of wine.\nThe southern side, where the towns sit. Messengers and merchants come and go in spades, the value they trade in circulating through the villages. The lords recognize as much, hence why Ibut's lord ameer had such a special fondness for the place. Sargon's unbearably chaotic, barbaric politics never interested me, but I needed the lord's support. The division of powers within the Reefsteep Black Market bored me so much I'm loathe to mention it, but we all had something to say when it came to the lord. I'm surprised that I held such frail relations for so long; a lord that doesn't judge by the cover, perhaps? Out of respect, I didn't personally attend the revolt. But once his family were puppets, I did show up to pay respects to that poor boyâ€”he was akin to Elliot. Akin to me.\nThe Reefsteep Black Market's center. An old tomb lies there, an ancient pasha's grave. Every night, Isin carefully wipes his memory under the light of the stars. A long time ago, I exhausted his wealth. And by now, I've repaid him several times over, but he doesn't pay any mind. His age looms by the day, and aside from a few errant, insignificant questions, we never even speak.\nThat day, Old Isin asked me why others call me 'Sand Soldier.'\n'Sand Soldier.'\nThe meaninglessness of a grain of sand. The pathetic fate of a pawn. The term is filled with significance I abhor.\nHence why I gladly accepted it. As a price paid in advance, for the impossible trial to follow. The Reefsteep Black Market had its towns, and they were fuel ready for the fire.\nI waited for the lord ameer of Ibut to come. If I could, I would have burned even the golden sands to nothing.\nAnd in the final moment before I set the flame alightâ€”\nâ€”what came to mind was the afternoon a young Elliot Glover was taken to tour an institute of science, where he sees a new model of Originium engine ignite and combust, upon which a tremendous machine stirs to life. He's always remembered how much that moved him.\nI've always remembered.",
