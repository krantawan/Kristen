She once hoped to stand out from the crowd with her Originium Arts and mastery of military theory, and thus to contribute to the restoration of Gaul. However, in the end she became infected with Oripathy during a mission and was expelled from the Victorian military.\nUnder her family's influence, Pith was once a committed Gaul restorationist. While she had come to understand the plight of the Sarkaz when she fought alongside Sarkaz mercenaries—and due to the destruction of Gaul very much sympathized with them losing their homeland—it wasn't until she became Infected that she truly understood why the Sarkaz are ostracized. Not only are they a wandering people with nowhere to go, they are also Infected. Having just become Infected herself, Pith had recently lost the social status she'd earned through years of hard work, and felt nothing but hopelessness and anger toward this huge difference in treatment. She joined Babel at the recommendation of her old Sarkaz mercenary friends. Not for any glorious ideals, though. On one hand, she wanted revenge on Victoria. On the other, she wanted to make it clear that she had completely cut ties with her family, leaving her truly without a home.\nDuring her years in Babel, Theresa treated her like a best friend. It made her feel like she had a new family, with new brothers and sisters. It was around this time that her preconceptions about race and ethnicity gradually disappeared. She came to firmly believe that only when all of Terra bands together will the Oripathy problem be solved. Which is why she never left us, even after Babel fell. Instead, she joined Rhodes Island as one of its first operators, to bring that seemingly unrealistic ideal to fruition.\nPith doesn't simply use the same kind of Arts over and over. Thanks to her talent and her studies, she knows the casting methods of almost all of our Caster operators' Arts like the back of her hand. During missions, she casts different combinations of types based on her assessment of the battlefield. At the same time, she makes sure to guide our other Casters' Arts to maximize their lethality.",
