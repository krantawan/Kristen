He was a stereotypical honors student since childhood, and was smoothly admitted into a famous local polytechnic university.\nHis focus in learning made him particularly clumsy when socializing with others, and he was always written off as a typical nerd, useless for anything other than his good grades.\nHowever, he cared little about the opinions of those around him. He simply continued forward, striving to catch up to his esteemed older brother - a brilliant, sensible, eloquent, and proficient prodigy who had already secured various patents for his inventions. Sesa threw himself at his studies to be admitted to the same prestigious school as his brother with the hope of one day working with him.\nSesa's brother, seven years his elder, worked for a massive military contractor in Columbia after graduation, and put together the company's largest research lab. Six months before his graduation, Sesa finally arrived at the military laboratory for an internship. However, a cruel twist of fate separated the two brothers, when an explosion from an experimental accident claimed the life of his older brother. The sudden loss of his older brother shattered the goal he had poured himself into so ardently his whole life. With his excellent grades, he was still able to continue his education, but he immediately rejected an invitation to stay at the lab and left the college after barely graduating.\nSesa secluded himself in his room for a long time until one day, he left a letter to his father and departed.",

Beyond the obvious, however, it is important to note that modifying Originium firearms is extremely dangerous. From the fact that his modifications allow those who cannot use Originium Arts to operate such weaponry, one can surmise that Sesa must have made many unfathomable breakthroughs in his craftsmanship. His name soon became a mainstay in the black markets due to his reputation for excellent craftsmanship. Surprisingly, Sesa's own talent for Originium Arts is not enough for him to easily master the use of Originium equipment. In fact, he struggles to operate even the most basic of Originium weapons. For this somewhat famous weapon modifier, the reality seems a bit hard to believe as well, and this is perhaps the reason for the modifications he's made upon his own grenade launcher.\nLater, when we investigated the laboratory incident, we found that Sesa's late brother, as the leader of the military laboratory, was far more proficient in Originium Arts than Sesa.\nThis may be the reason why Sesa has gone through such painstaking efforts, tapping into a far greater talent so that he too may be able to pick up a grenade launcher.",

We found it difficult to believe that such an accident could take place in one of Columbia's most prestigious military laboratories. With this bit of skepticism in mind, we uncovered the greatest doubt of this whole incident: the fact that it was an illegal experiment.\nIn reality, the military giant that Sesa and his brother worked for did not focus on Originium firearms that can only be used by a select few, as the versatility and lethality of such weapons generally fell short of just applying Originium Arts to traditional crossbows.\nThough the most crucial information can only be understood by Columbian military and government officials, according to some contacts, we have every reason to believe that the project the two brothers pursued is the same one that Sesa has mastered - eliminate the high barrier of entry of using Originium firearms. This can also explain why the company has not faced any backlash from either the government or the private sector despite such a major accident. The person in charge of the ill-fated experiment has even risen through the ranks, becoming a point of resistance that even Rhodes Island cannot continue to investigate. \nIt must be noted that even though Sesa's work has been described with awe on the black market, all he can do is enhance existing weaponry. Though Sesa might come closer to it than most people, the idea of 'letting anyone pick up an Originium firearm even without being able to use Arts' is inherently not feasible and not allowed. Originium-based technology might still have its limitations, but if certain people throughout Terra catch wind of these developments and attempt to use this technology to escalate geopolitical conflicts, there is no telling what kind of brutal, all-consuming wars we may face in the future.\n'The power I deliver is growing closer to the real deal, and it is both dangerous and eye-catching... So, uh, that's why it's absolutely necessary to keep this technology under wraps!' He explained it himself.But if this is true, is it possible that the person responsible for the accident that buried Sesa's brother... Sesa himself? Despite attempts to verify this, Rhodes Island has no right to pry into a subject that he seeks to avoid.",

Where am I gonna get Blacksteel from? We lost a guy just trying to get this stuff.'\n'I need guns I can use! This shit is as good to me as a hammer!' The Vouivre bossman gets angrier, and an assortment of Vouivran musclemen line up behind him.\n'How are you going to use a gun if you can't do Originium Arts? Take it or leave it, I don't refund deposits.' The Sarkaz merchant waves his hand, and one after another, his partners draw their blades behind him.\n'I can fix this.'\nAs the hostility boils over, a young Vouivran man comes out from the corner. His face is stony, his build frail enough to not even seem Vouivre, and his head of red hair majorly garish.\n'I can make those guns usable, and it'd only cost you this much.'\nBoth sides seem convinced by this conservative bid, and make way for him to approach. They watch as the youngster comes up, cracks open the toolkit he keeps on him, and picks up one of the guns. The complete firearm is reduced to parts in his hands, before becoming whole again. His movements aren't fast by any measure, but nobody can tell what happened.\nThe youngster hands the bossman the assembled gun, who doubtfully accepts it. After cautiously fumbling with it, he points the muzzle at the air and pulls the trigger. A clear gunshot resounds through the whole black market.\n'It can only fire one shot. If you want it completely functional, I'll have to take it back to my workshop.'\nEveryone present was ready to slit throats a moment ago, but now all are in unanimous accord. A dozen pairs of eyes focus on the youngster, as if they've found something worth far more than the goods.\n'Boy, what did you do just now?'\n'Don't be twitchy, just hand it over and nothing bad will happen.'\nAs everyone closes in step by step, he suddenly grins and laughs:\n'You foolish philistines! Trying to get a peek of true power with your petite experience? Let me tell you, weapons have souls! Only the truly wise, the truly noble can resonate with them!'\nFor a moment, the chaotic scene once again falls quiet as can be.\n'Lunatic,' the Sarkaz spits.\nThe bossman pulls a whole pile of cash from his briefcase and hands it to the youngster, while the Sarkaz merchant takes the rest and leaves, not bothering with a single glance back.\n'Boy, you can keep your secrets if you want. I'll give you money and a workspace, and you work for me. How does that sound?' He offers an invitation to the bizarre youth.\n'Deal.'\nThe youngster takes up residence in the workroom the bossman gives him. Late at night, he carefully fills a notepad with the quantity and models of the guns from earlier that day, annotated with 'Columbian make, smuggled into Sargon by Sarkaz merchant, circumstances unclear.'\n'Good. We start from here.'"
