You suspect our underground arena of concealing and reselling your drugs?\n'No, let me finish commentating this match first! This is freedom, passion, one against many, the weak against the strong! THIS IS THE TRUE FACE OF THE UNDERGROUND RING!'\nA few Rhodes Island operators haul the commentator off, parrying the bottles and worn boxing gloves lobbed by the rowdy spectators, before a group of fiendish thugs blocks their path. Not that the ops want to escalate this any further, but the ringside is in chaos by now.\nThey're about to put on Shura's mouthguards and personally get to know the rules of the underground arena, but the mince-no-words Ursine opts to leap down from the ring and stop them.\n'I'll deal with 'em! Underground fight rules are MY rules!'\nIn Shura's memory, this is where she grew up, right here on the shabby stage under the sickly lights, under the cheers and jeers as the ref sounded the bell. Here, she faced opponents far stronger than her, matches called to screw her over. Here, she faced all that she couldn't see through and couldn't take down, and it didn't take long for her to learn to grin and bear it. Go down? Get up again. Keep throwing your fists. Use all your strength. Show 'em how done dirty you feel, deep inside. Free the rebel in your blood.\nOnce Shura comes back to reality, her fellow ops are bracing her. They're already leaving the underground arena. Once again, she took on a million to one. Once again, she won enough time for her friends to get back what was theirs. She hears them discuss a celebratory dinner tonight, floating the idea of ordering her a tub of honey so deep she'll never finish chugging. Finally, the corners of her mouth pull up in a punch-drunk smile, tortured muscles screaming with delayed-onset but oh so true pain.\n'Shura... you're pretty freaking beat up. Maybe we get a medic to treat you first?'\n'Oof... eaargh, I'll shake it off!'\nThe moment she loosens her jaw, her mouthguards drop right out. With a massive start, the gang realizes she's already chewed the damn things to pieces."
