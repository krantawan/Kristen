HR's been sorting out some operator files, and the name pops up now and then in the Abyssal Hunter mission reports. I thought I'd do some investigating...'\n'You've got a real demon on your line there! You know how Skadi fights, right? How she can tear down a town on her lonesome? Columbia's engineers must love her. Well, Skadi was taught by that 'Ulpianus' guy. He can blend in with the shadows, with only his sinister eyes showing. He's also got freakish strength, able to hoist a giant four-pronged anchor, every blow a miniature explosion. He rampages through the seas, not caring if he's fighting friend or foe, a terror as famous as the Seaborn...'\n'Closure, what are you talking about?'\n'What I'm saying is you should stow your curiosity and get back to work.'\n—Recording of a conversation between Closure and an HR Operator in a meeting room\n\nBy the time I joined the Hunters as a representative of the Legions, Ulpianus was already a veteran of five years. The lab kept his data and images from before he volunteered for the transformation. I would hesitate to call him strong. Perhaps 'somewhat feeble'? And aside from some characteristic clothing he likes to wear, the difference between then and now could not be greater. Strictly speaking, his condition was not up to the standards he himself would later establish for subjects. But at the time, the project was finally entering the clinical stage, and he chose to take that strange flesh into his body, advancing the development of the immature gene remodeling procedure... The cost? Compared to the project potentially losing its lead researcher, the many scars he gained are a negligible price. No, I do not care if he did it out of responsibility or worry. My main point is that he succeeded.\nFor a Hunter, his physical parameters are not particularly outstanding. In terms of only endurance or speed, he cannot compare to me or Skadi. But he chose an appropriate weapon for his fighting style, raining down brute force in exacting, methodical swings—something he often taught Skadi. That ridiculous anchor of his is nothing more than his surgeon's blade. It is not a light weapon, so every strike must give the enemy a grievous wound, one that would be hard to heal from.\n...It seems his every decision is like this. Him becoming Ægir's first Abyssal Hunter, him fighting to the last, and now his departure from Ægir. This is what both his reliability and his risk stem from.\n—Gladiia",

Oh, yeah, don't let Hypatia see those lecture tapes.'\n'Doesn't Hypatia teach history? Don't tell me she's getting into bioengineering too? They're not even remotely the same!'\n'No, you haven't seen how that masked Ægir in the tapes teaches. Hypatia prefers the edutainment model of teaching, so I think she'd have an aneurysm if she saw it. It's so stifling!

He'd suddenly stop and be silent, then the students in the lab would ask questions one by one. Can you imagine?! Most of them, he wouldn't even answer, or just coldly say 'Wrong question. Ask another.' And they'd keep on asking... By the time you actually managed to ask a question he felt like answering, you'd already know the gist of the whole thing anyway.'\n'Ægir's a country governed by scientists and engineers, so there's always going to be a few eccentrics like him.

He's just a bit awkward at social interaction, and not really suited to being a teacher. She does think that sort of questioning is rather normal, though. She once managed to get answers to ten questions in a row, and she thinks it's a very efficient way to communicate. It can get you to reflect on things and find your blind spots.

Do you think the Abyssal Hunters are only killing machines? Sure, Ægir's general education doesn't include music or dance classes, but the Little Handy module No.57 has more music than what any terrestrial music critic could hope to have. The domes are like giant pianos, converting the crashing of the waves into sweet melodies. The shifting frequency and movements of the coral by the roads is itself a form of dance... Music and dance are a part of everything we Ægir see and hear. That's how Swordfish, Shark, and I learned how to sing, play instruments, and dance. Our colleagues at the Institutes of Physical Art don't see systematic learning as necessary. They research anything and everything in the ocean and its relation to music and dance to develop a 'language' they can use to truly express themselves and communicate with the world.\nThe Captain's even more talented than the rest of us. He's got perfect pitch, and he's a composer too. I heard from Advisor Blandus that he got an invitation to one of those art institutes when he was young... Right, I mentioned this before: He sees music as nothing more than a tool. Each time we had a hunt in a Seaborn nest, he'd always haphazardly compose a tune, then order everyone in the his team to memorize it. Then after the battle, he'd ask us to sing it back to him and give his opinion. The dregs of the sea can't appreciate art. Memorizing the melody is enough to prove you're still you. So he'd do this before returning to the city for inspection to see who'd be executed and left to dry on the reefs, and who'd be allowed to go home.\nBut there's something else that left a deeper impression on me. Once, during a mission, we ran into two schools of rare fins. They cried out, their chatter all around us, disturbing most of the current. Once we got back to the city, the first thing the Captain did was to upload a score into the port's terminal. I had a listen after that. It was a duet, the cries of the fins poking out between the notes of the main melody. Ever since the Seaborn took over that patch of sea, that duet is the last record of those fins. It's hard to say it was a coincidence, knowing him. It's a beautiful song, but doesn't exactly match his icy expression.\n...\nNo, I'm not trying to prove anything to you, nor can I prove anything to Ægir. I just wanted to say...\nHe can still sing. Both when the scum devoured Amaia and the sea around the Stultifera Navis fell into Silence, and when Milliarium's beacon tower fell to the seafloor... I could still hear him.\n—Skadi",

But whether in the oceanic abyss or Iberia, Seaborn with different morphologies still share common characteristics: sleek bodies, sturdy flesh, a certain quickness. Proof of their relationship to Ishar'mla. But quite a few of the Seaborn we saw in Milliarium had divergent characteristics... Yes, this is not enough to prove that there is a new, independent bloodline within the Seaborn, but there is no doubt they have been influenced by some other, superior being. The new 'gods' of these beasts are stirring. We do not know where, or how many.\nMártus. I know this Seaborn sought you out. He revealed to you some shocking truths, some new laws of nature. Clementia locked down this information very well. I do not mean to debate you on this. We are saving ourselves, along with everything we care about. I see 'savior' and 'creator' as rather laughable titles. What I care about, though, is that he shows no fear. He believes that even with all his cards on the table, we will have no means of stopping the evolution of the Seaborn. And so I must follow him back to the heart of the sea. My assimilation was too short, my resonance with we many too shallow, and there is much I cannot yet answer. Every unusual phenomenon in the ocean, every minute warning sign, demands our attention. The seafloor volcanoes suddenly appearing these past two years, shining patches of sea that move, and that legendary 'iceberg'... I doubt it is a mere congregation of ice and snow, but rather a giant hive, an ecological system composed of chitin, daughter cells, and nutrients joined together. It does exist, and it is now 'thawing' above some patch of sea. I have already sent you the coordinates. You can try to confirm them with Gladiia.\n...\nI am still lucid.

Laurentina turns with a smile and offers a quick 'thank you' as she gracefully leaves the lab. On the other side, Secunda suddenly stands up from behind the file shelf, staring intently at Ulpianus's back.\nAfter a moment's hesitation, she speaks resolutely. 'Professor, I have a personal question.'\n'Ask.' Ulpianus doesn't turn around.\n'Why do you always wear the same clothes? You've been dressed like that since the day I met you.'\n'Frankly, he's been dressing like that since he was a student. He's hardly changed his outfits at all over the years as I remember, and they always follow the same style, each more buttoned-up than the last. But I'd rather discourage such idle curiosity,' Blandus chimes in.\n'Wrong question.' Ulpianus still doesn't turn around, his voice cold and firm.\n'Understood!' Secunda answers brightly as she quickly leaves the lab.\nTwenty minutes later, she reappears at the door.\n'Professor, let me rephrase my question. Why do you rotate between dozens of outfits that look identical but differ slightly in material, craftsmanship, weight, and texture?'\n'Still imprecise,' Ulpianus says, casting a quick glance at her before returning to his work sorting the mountain of Seaborn specimens.\nAnother twenty minutes pass, and Secunda appears again at the lab entrance, pen in hand.\n'Professor, I've compared the differences in your outfits and analyzed the changes in your physical metrics, and I've found a preliminary correlation. Considering that combat gear aids Hunters in coordinating bodily movements, I hypothesize that you adjust details in your attire to match changes in your physical state, ensuring optimal control over your body in all conditions.'\nAfter a brief silence, Ulpianus's ear moves slightly, as if signaling her to continue.\n'However, this hypothesis leaves some gaps. Is there another variable influencing your choice of attire?'\n'Indeed, Secunda.' Ulpianus finally turns around. 'You haven't noticed the correlation between the songs I compose pre-battle and my chosen outfit, but as those compositions have never been recorded, it's understandable you didn't realize this.'\n'You mean, the other variable is...'\n'My thoughts at the time.'\n'Hold on!' At some point, Blandus had emerged from the partition. 'Ulpianus, that's not what you said when you explained it to me! You said it was because you didn't want to attract—'\n'There are always more than one reason, Blandus.' Ulpianus cuts him off. 'What I told you was what you needed to know, and what I told her was what she needed to know. Nothing more.'"
