Unfortunately, these exercises didn't make her strong enough for the hefty battle-axe tactics demanded of her. Not only did she fail to earn good marks in her training, she made many high-profile mistakes in her practical lessons, such as mishandling her weapon and destroying public property. \nPlume did not let these setbacks get to her. She calmly analyzed her performance to find out where she went wrong. After seeking guidance from other members of the Guard, she took their advice and started doing exercises focused on battle axe technique and attack speed. \nAfter abandoning the brute force route and focusing on technique, Plume worked hard to create a simple but effective battle style. She darts swiftly around the battlefield, launching quick offensive strikes, downing her targets just as quickly. \nAlthough she is not strong enough for head-on assault missions, Plume can fulfill all the basic duties of an Operator. Whether on offense or defense, Plume can hold her own, all while keeping high spirits and a strong will.",

With no distinction between her work and private lives. She could even see her work as a form of entertainment. \nBut after joining Rhodes Island, she began to see the appeal of having a life outside of work. \nAccording to Plume, Rhodes Island doesn't have some aloof aristocracy she needs to put her life on the line to protect (though she believes such people don't actually need protection), and life is not as regimented and ritualized as she is used to. Diverse individuals with all personality types can fill the halls, and there's no distinguishing rank among them. Everyone has their own lifestyle--this has had a tremendous impact on her.\nPlume tried to maintain her Laterano Guard ways of thinking, but her sharp eye is dazzled by all of the colorful characters around her. She has been unable to ignore this diversity. \nIn fact, Plume has said she is considering changing her image. We see this sort of thing whenever a new Operator is starting to integrate themselves into Rhodes Island life. \nPerhaps she could start by smiling more?",
