Her words reflect a remarkable nonchalance. This is an important reason why many consider her to be more terrifying than even less personable colleagues.

Once the Rhodes Island ship has docked at a certain location, Operators are free to carry out activities in the locale as long as they maintain contact with the ship and do not act in a way that would damage the interests of Rhodes Island.\nBeyond this point, however, Ms. Mostima also has a few peculiarities. According to the application she submitted, Ms. Mostima often proactively seeks out delivery orders that would require her to travel abroad. Usually, Rhodes Island couriers will only operate in a local vicinity, because the time and risk involved in long-distance travel is a serious consideration for even the most experienced in the industry. Yet it doesn't seem to concern Ms. Mostima.\nDoes this mean that she has a special reason for doing so?",

Yet, he had long since ceased to care about any of that. At some point, he began to talk to his staff day after day. Everyone thought he had gone insane.\nWhen he was 40 years old, he suddenly disappeared from inside the palace one day, and no one knew where he'd gone. Rumors began to spread in certain parts of Kazdel that a madman would tell certain impossible predictions to anyone who passed him by in the barrenlands. For example, that a giant beast would soon lay waste to our nation and that the sky would one day tear in two and reveal its true face. Afterward, he would peddle his watches to whoever stopped to listen, and should they refuse, he would bring their time to a halt.\nBy the time he was 100, he no longer knew where he was, but that no longer held any meaning to him. He believed he was seeking the secrets behind time itself.\nHe had the Key, but where was the Lock?\nHe had the Lock, but where was the Key?\nThe past becomes the future, and the future shall have no secrets. Day after day, he talked to his own shadow, firmly believing that the truth was hidden within.\nUntil one day, footsteps echoed throughout, as three Sankta walked into the underground palace.",

      "desc": "'Pasha, Your Excellency, this is the fifth story I've told for you. I hope it was to your satisfaction?'\nIn the resplendent palace of Sargon, a blue-haired Messenger, dressed in attire markedly different from those around her, stands at the foot of the steps, bowing respectfully toward the Pasha seated on his throne.\nOn the high platform, the richly dressed Pasha gestures to his attendant, whispering something to him. The attendant's face briefly shows a hint of surprise, then he steps forward to loudly announce the Pasha's decree—\n'Messenger, my lord had never heard of such ruins hidden within the Black Flow, nor of the history buried within Victoria's ancient battlefields. Your stories have greatly pleased him, and he is willing to forge a friendship with Yvangelista XI from afar.'\n'Thank you very much.' The blue-haired Messenger gives a polite and confident Sargonian court bow and begins to turn to leave. But the attendant speaks again, 'Don't be in such a hurry, Messenger. My lord has one more question for you.'\n'Please, go ahead.'\n'My lord wishes to ask if you would stay and tell him the remaining nine hundred and ninety-five stories?'\n'Does... His Excellency the Pasha mean that he wishes for me to relinquish my role as a Messenger, and remain by his side?'\n'Precisely. My lord offers you wealth and luxury here, in exchange for sharing with him all your enchanting stories.'\nThe blue-haired Messenger smiles. 'I thank His Excellency for his kindness, but I am accustomed to my life of freedom; such riches and luxury are not suited to me.'\nThe Pasha whispers a few more words to the attendant, who then steps forward again. 'You are already an outlier among the Sankta. Your kin will not accept you, and your homeland has no place for you. Why go to such lengths on their behalf?'\nThis time, the blue-haired Messenger pauses to think before answering, 'I don't journey for my kin, nor do I long for my homeland. In the beginning, it was an old friend who set me on my travels. Now, I travel out of curiosity for a certain story.'\n'What kind of story?'\n'An old man once told me a story before I left. It was a silly story about everyone eating ice cream together under the sun. But as I traveled, I began to see what was intriguing about it—and as I reflected more and more on it, I discovered even more stories.' The blue-haired Messenger gives another courtly bow. 'You should instead let me travel as far as possible, so that when I return, I may regale you with even more wondrous tales.'\nThe Pasha no longer tries to persuade her, only ordering that, whenever the blue-haired Messenger returned, the palace gates would always be open to her. As they walk out of the palace, her red-haired companion, who had been silently listening all along, finally can't hold back and asks, 'Did His Holiness really tell you a story like that?'\nA smile appears at the corner of the blue-haired Messenger's mouth. 'What do you think?'",
