The Rhodes Island Operators then disarmed her and dropped her off at the Leithanian branch of Rhodes Island, but due to the deteriorating living conditions of the Infected in Leithanien, the team finally brought Ceobe back to the vessel. Along the way, Ceobe, who had always kept her distance from civilization, was slightly wary of communicating with others. However, after coming to Rhodes Island, she began to gain a new understanding of the people who had bested her - eat well, drink well, sleep well, and beat up bad people. Coincidentally, these are all things that she likes to do, so upon an Operator's recommendation, she joined Rhodes Island without hesitation.",

With the exception of the few familiar faces she had met before, there were far too many people waiting to make her acquaintance. Of course, her priority is not so much becoming acquainted with people, but rather becoming acquainted with food. In the place where everyone gathers to eat, there is a certain door. On the other side is a world of countless edibles, waiting for her to sample. She's not particularly subtle in her efforts to sneak in, resulting in a high probability of being found and shown the way out. However, that doesn't seem to deter her - at least until she's tasted the contents of all the bottles and cans there.\nIn light of the fact that Ceobe is still learning about the norms of civilized life, everyone privately agreed to not punish her when she gets caught, and some people even took the opportunity to feed Ceobe some strange things. Though these people usually fall under one of three categories - the experimenters, the kind-hearted, and those who just wanted to make fun of her, Ceobe generally only has two words to say about the things she eats: 'Yummy,' or 'Good.' No one can coax any other words out of Ceobe - naturally, the experimenters can't get the kind of data they're looking for, the kind-hearted pretty much all get the same few responses, and those who try to make fun of Ceobe are undertaking a self-defeating task. Over time, the number of people casually trying to feed Ceobe decreased as well.\nAlthough she has indulged in many foods of all shapes and sizes since coming to Rhodes Island, if asked to pick out the food she loved the most, she would choose honey biscuits. As a matter of fact, honey biscuits are the only thing that she seems to be picky with - currently, she only accepts biscuits baked by Lava, Vulcan, and Matterhorn. She won't touch even a single crumb of the biscuits baked by anyone else - even by the logistics chief.\nSummary: She won't eat, but she absolutely can eat just about everything. She loves honey biscuits. If the day comes where she's in the mood to eat the entirety of Rhodes Island, she'll likely do just that.",

Though the Doctor looks a lot weaker than her, she finds the Doctor to be much smarter than even Vulcan, capable of explaining concepts that seem utterly inconceivable to her in just a few simple words so that she can understand the gist of things. When being briefed on missions, she couldn't wrap her head around things like tactical simulations, but the Doctor had a brilliant idea - by giving her simple, concrete commands such as 'stand here,' 'attack this,' or 'fight until I arrive,' she was able to complete her missions. As a result, Ceobe was able to save some brain cells, and the Doctor entered the ranks of the few people who Ceobe would completely set her weapons down around.\nOther than the Doctor, the person who Ceobe respects the most is Vulcan.",

Her curiosity led her to seek the meaning behind the axe, so she stopped to ask a question to the first person she could find - and thus began her life of wandering. Along the way, when she got hungry, she ate wild fruits. When she was thirsty, she drank water from the rivers. Her journeys took her away from most of civilization. Because she didn't have the ability to discern areas that were contaminated with Originium, Ceobe quickly contracted Oripathy, and what she described as 'black crystals' started to appear across some parts of her body. At first, these growths were a source of fear for her, but as she continued to wander, she began to see the power that these crystals had brought her - her weapons had grown stronger. Ceobe's fears were soon replaced with a strong desire to obtain more weapons, an uncontrollable impulse that often drove her to resort to violence to satisfy. Though she tried to suppress these impulses and use peaceful methods to obtain weapons, the outcomes would often differ greatly from her expectations. Sometimes she would rescue others, sometimes she would injure them; Some would reward her with weapons for completing tasks for them, some would use weapons to try to lure her, while others would gift them to her with no strings attached. In any case, her journey took her far to the east, where a well-intentioned person told her that she had taken the wrong way. With her large collection of weapons and tales in tow, she turned around and returned west. Her journey finally came to an end when she attacked a Rhodes Island squad led by Fang while trying to obtain food.\nWhile Ceobe lacked the qualifications to become an Operator, the HR Department finally gave her an opportunity to take the Operator evaluation exam upon Vulcan's recommendation. She had no expectation of becoming an Operator, nor did she know what such a job entailed, but she still demonstrated a great desire to become one. After becoming a fully-fledged member in Rhodes Island, her daily routine of eating, drinking, and fighting, combined with medical treatment of her Oripathy, also alleviated her strange fixation upon collecting weapons. She has grown accustomed to her comfortable lifestyle, and hopes that her time her can last forever if possible...\nAs long as someone can unlock the secret of her axe.",

Because the enchanting process requires a suitable weapon to serve as a carrier, each enchantment will instinctively 'choose' its own weapon and then, in accordance with the quality of the weapon, the enchantment will confer a different Originium Arts characteristic, such as flames, rocks, or ice. In the past, this ability was a subconscious process that she could not control, and therefore she didn't give much thought into it. Now, under the tutelage of Rhodes Island Operators, she is working hard to understand her unique skill: though she may never be able to master the fundamentals of Originium Arts through studying, she must learn enough to operate her skills on a basic level, which would be enough to help her achieve a baseline level of identification and control and strengthen her abilities all around. Today, Rhodes Island has developed a comprehensive learning plan for Ceobe, and as long as she is willing to sit down in a classroom and begin working on her literacy, we have reason to believe that she can become an excellent Arts user in the future.\n'Feel free to dream.' --Anonymous comments",

Ceobe couldn't pay so she took out a broken arrow and a glass tube that she didn't know where she got.\nIn the midst of that business, Ceobe heard someone shouting outside, 'Thief!'\nCeobe grabbed the bread and rushed out.\n\nThe second thing she couldn't understand was why bad people would steal wallets and make it hard for people to eat bread.\nShe was chasing a motorcycle, and the motorcycle was vrooming along the field. And then the sky was getting dark. She got tired of chasing, but the bad guy was still sitting on the motorcycle.\nShe heard the bad guy shouting excitedly, 'She's been chasing us all this time! What kind of monster is she?! Let's fight her!'\nThe motorcycle stopped, and then the bad guy ran over with a metal stick and got knocked over with a 'thud' sound.\nCeobe held the bread and looked at him.\n\nThe third thing that Ceobe couldn't understand was why other people could suddenly hear weapons talking too.\nThe people who got their wallets back surrounded her. She stood in front of the boss and said she wanted to keep the bread for herself. That's because she heard the bread talking to her, and the bread was also a weapon.\n'What did the bread say?' the gentle boss asked her.\nCeobe tilted her head and thought for a while, and listened for a while: 'The bread sounds like a grumbling stomach.'\nSo Ceobe left the houses and the very flat road with a large bag of bread. The bread that could be used to hit people didn't talk anymore and became too hard to bite, which was strange.\nCeobe thought that one day she could come to understand these things."

Not even wagging my tail worked. She was a like a rock, and I couldn't make her budge at all...\n‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî\nToday... the little steel knife I just bought... broke...\nVulcan says they used bad steel, and the forgework was suspect, so it would've snapped fast even if it wasn't me using it.\nI don't get it, the words just fly past me. Inside my head it's all empty, so empty I can't think of anything.\n......\nBy the time I snap out of it, Vulcan's at work.\nShe looks at me, stops what she's doing, and puts a big chunk of metal in the furnace.\nThen she pushes her hammer into my hands, and makes me hold it.\nThe cloth on the handle is still sort of wet, and warm, and it's hard to get your hands off once you're holding on tight. But it's really heavy too. How does she swing it so much all the time?\nI want to ask her something or other... um... but she's staring at that metal chunk. It's all red now. Better not bother her.\nThe furnace is kinda roasting the air. When she's not watching, I lightly tap my palm with the hammer, so I can imagine what it'd be like swinging it with all my strength.\nIt's gotta hurt a lot.\n......\nAfter a while, Vulcan pulls the red-hot metal out from the furnace and puts it on the anvil, then takes the hand I'm holding the hammer in, and swings down with it.\nThunk!\nMy hand kinda hurts, and my ears are humming a little, but I'm super duper happy, so I don't mind it at all.\nIs this forging? Is Vulcan teaching me to forge? Am I gonna become an awesome blacksmith just like her?!\n......\nNo, I can't do it...\nEven though she's been next to me all day teaching me what to do, all I made in the end was this metal... chunk? Strip? Sheet?\nThe surface is all dented and bumpy, and there's no sharp edge. I can't beat up bad guys with it, just bonk them.\nNow I've wasted her good metal. She's gotta be really mad...\nShe... gave me a little biscuit and said I did pretty well?\nReally? Am I good at this?!\nHeheh~\nI think I'll keep it with my other baby weapons.\nMaybe it's not all that pretty.\nBut it's my knife, and I made it.\nIt's really strong, and really hard.\nIt can clobber bad guys and shoot out super lightning!\nI love it~"
