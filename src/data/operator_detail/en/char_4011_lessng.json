Looking at the way he swings his tape-wrapped claymore though, one cannot help but wonder if he is truly Leithanian. After all, all things Leithanian are supposed to be elegant and beautiful, from music to art to Arts to swordplay. But Lessing's fighting style is plain and unembellished, the ultimate expression of efficiency. The one-swing, one-kill approach not only requires heightened concentration, perception, and reaction speed, it also requires a motion that holds nothing back, putting great strain on the body. In other words, Lessing's swordplay places unbelievable stress on both mind and body, but he seems entirely unconcerned. When I advised him to be more careful, he looked as though he'd been told to stop eating his food so quickly.\nI know many are curious about the tape he wraps around his sword... There are rumors that he studied with an ill-tempered Arts master, and that the tape is the key to unlocking terrifying Arts. The latest version of the rumors even claim that the sword transforms into a massive monster—larger than Rhodes Island itself—if the tape is removed, devouring any living thing that it touches without a single trace.\nThe truth was finally revealed when some of the bolder operators invited him to spar 'holding nothing back.' While Lessing does have considerable skill in Arts, he uses them sparingly, and is a far cry from the legendary caster the rumors speak of. As for the tape, it does not seem to serve any special purpose other than wrapping around the sword's blade.\n'Someone like him really only has two reasons to wrap up his sword.\n'One, to make it less conspicuous.\n'Two, to avoid hurting others.'",

No surprise there, everyone needs to let some steam off, after all, no matter how disciplined. So I cracked open the door, and almost went deaf. He was just banging away at the drums.

So what if he needed to let off some steam?'\n'I didn't dare go in, so I waited for him to come out, which took quite a while. I asked him how he was feeling, and told him he could come talk to us if he ever feels stressed at Rhodes Island, because we're all friends here. And you know what he said? He said that was how he thinks, relaxes, gets rid of extraneous thoughts... Basically, he's meditating in the midst of deafening drums.\n'Wow.'\n'......'\n'Well, never mind that.

            "storyText": "[Urtica Investigation Report Excerpts]\nLessing's upbringing was much simpler than expected. He was born to serve the Graf Urtica, as every child in his family has for generations. This tradition was abolished by the Witch King when he ascended to the position of Graf Urtica, but the Maeyer family took up the responsibility of protecting the Grafschaft of their own accord, working tirelessly to maintain the territory's order and prosperity.\nThe aftermath of the Witch King's fall hit the family especially hard. Though no member of the family was officially denounced as an associate of the Witch King, they were put under surveillance for years, and the family went into decline. A few years later, the spire of Urtica welcomed a new Graf. Perhaps as part of the surveillance, or perhaps to curry favor with the new lord, a noble came to the Maeyer farm and requested they send their youngest child into the spire.\nThat child did indeed come to the spire, his fate once again aligned with that of his family's, but a contradictory edict came the day he was expecting to meet the Graf who would be his master. \n\n[Scattered Records From Ludwigs-Universität]\nOh, pay no heed to the child, Lessing Maeyer. He's no threat.\nSo what if he grew up by the seat of my teacher? I know him. We're of the same kind. A trapped beast extending his tongue, trying to taste the sweetness of fate outside the cage, but his vision is so narrow that he can only see the dust-filled corners, not the spectacular scene above his head.\nWhat I shame... I thought he would be a comrade. When he fought back against the Gendarmerie who were dispersing the crowd and was beaten within an inch of his life, I didn't think he'd get back up, scratching and clawing, snatching the Gendarmerie's badge, biting until his mouth was bloodied. He yelled at the Gendarmerie, 'What difference is there between you and the people you're beating?' Even the professor glanced at him that day...\nI was the one who brought him back, gave him a chance to live. But he didn't learn a thing from the professor. Still just as useless, but with more shackles.\n...Maybe I was wrong, maybe the professor never looked at him at all.\n\n[Conversation Log]\n'If not for the professor's insistence, the Liches would have left Leithanien following the death of Herkunftshorn. The Twin Spires of the empresses are imposing, but hardly reassuring. Just because the sunset no longer tasted of blood didn't mean it was perfect. There are cracks in even the most beautiful of clouds. A new change was brewing... it's a story we've seen many times. The Liches that remained in Zwillingstürme took more care to hide their tracks, bringing their research projects to a close and were ready to fly at a moment's notice. But then one day, the professor brought a Caprinae back to Ludwigs-Universität. He said he picked him up from the Gendarmerie. We were confused and alarmed. You understand, right? Who would take in a new pet while preparing to move? Well, that's what I complained to the professor about, at any rate.'\n'The Liches eventually got used to this outsider in their lives. You know how he is. He's like a piece of wood. You can't get a reaction out of him. Weird, yeah, but that weirdness comes in handy sometimes. When the professor is angry, the students dare not go into his office, and even the other Liches keep their threads stowed, lest he drag them inside and gives them a verbal smackdown. Lessing's the only one with the nerve to push through the crowd, open the door, head into the office, and pick up the books and equipment scattered on the ground, all without the slightest sliver of an expression on his face. It's like he's completely deaf, as the professor put it. Anyway, we learned to tell when it was safe to go in by the change in volume after Lessing went in. He doesn't talk much, but he's pretty reliable. Anything that's inconvenient for the Liches to do or buy on their own, they ask him to do, so he goes into town every month with a long shopping list, and comes back hanging a bunch of bags on his sword...\n'Say, do you think you can give him the occasional vacation, you know, to visit Kazdel from time to time? I-I'm not saying we need him around to deal with the professor. Just tell him that, er, his sister and the rest of his family, er, miss him. Right, miss him.'",

There were tire tracks nearby. A farmer must have accidentally hit it while driving by.\nLessing carefully straightened the spruce. He had no shovel on him, so he used his sword to dig at the soil, pile it around the tree's roots, and hardened it by stomping his foot.\nThen he sat down and gazed at the forest before him, not caring about the dirt. Spruces grew all over the wilderness of Leithanien, with no pattern or order. It was an utterly unremarkable sight. Therefore, when back at the Graf's tower Ebenholz asked him where he went, he said it was just out for a walk. In fact, he liked this place, visiting it almost daily before he left for Zwillingstürme, sometimes training, sometimes daydreaming. Rain and storms were frequent, often toppling trees. Other times, craftsmen and farmers took wood from the forest for materials and firewood, but the forest nonetheless grew year after year. Now, it was twice as big as he remembered, so big he could not see where it ended, its canopies blocking out the sun's rays like a mountain range. The spruce, a tree that grew all over the wilderness of Leithanien, so unremarkable that no one thinks to plant them near the spires. But they grow straight and tall, sometimes even taller than the spires. And they will still be here, after all the spires of Leithanien are gone.",

Its crossguard was wider than most people's arms, and its blade longer than most people were tall. The sealed sword showed nary a hint of edge, and while it was unable to kill in this state, the sight of it was enough to send a shiver down anyone's spine—perhaps this was its purpose, perhaps the youth who carried the blade did not wish to take anyone's life. He simply wished to have a sword, for merely having a sword was itself a message to his opponents. That a bloody death was at hand, that all that it would take was to remove some flimsy bindings—so do not remove those bindings.\nThis really was what the youth thought. He deliberately wrapped his sword in bindings, hid its edge, concealed it, placed it where no one could see it. The blade required patience. Patience could avoid wearing it down, patience could avoid bloody carnage. Yet even if you remain patient for years, even if you placed it where no one could see it, it would still show its one true use at a glance. And so the youth treated the sword this way, just as the youth treated himself.\nHe said 'I am the sword, I am its cutting edge, but I must be hidden away and concealed.' He used to carry himself as such, taking his anger, his torments, his suffering, his joy, his excitement, his inspiration, and burying them within the thick layers of bindings, body and soul both stretched taut.\nBut now, it seems like everything has changed.\nEnemies appear from all directions—though it could hardly be called appearing, for the youth had already imagined them deep in the dense forests of Einwald, below the rainclouds of Sturmland, within the great lakes and rivers of Wasserland, entrenched atop the mud and stones of Erdenherre, their silhouettes doing their dealings amongst the spires, darting between the palaces, the academies, and the mansions. So these were hardly a surprise to him, but he simply did not expect today's situation. When a time comes where push truly comes to shove, might he find that he can no longer see their faces clearly, or know where they were? The enemy is not yet at hand, yet he knows that they are everywhere. He had clearly bound the wrapping in thick layers, yet why did he feel so exposed these days? He had anticipated, prepared for this day. Had known it would come. Fremont had already warned him earlier: this is a battle you chose yourself.\nIt is a battle I chose myself, the youth thought, his sword sealed anew.",

      "desc": "Lessing is coming! To thank him for always putting up with our Professor's fury, we Liches have drawn up a 'destress and decompress' program so he can enjoy a vacation completely free of worries. Here goes—\n1. Dine at the finest of restaurants. Check! Outcome: This boy just refuses to sit down and enjoy some proper top-shelf service. We had to drag him back by all those straps he wears and bind him in his place before he'd finally open his mouth and eat. Ugh. Our adorable baby brother leaves us for hardly a moment, and THIS is how he comes back to us?\n2. Gift him a whole new set of clothes. Check! Outcome: So this is how it feels to buy clothes for your children! Not bad. You know, he's actually quite like a natural clothes hanger when you think about it. He just seemed verrrry put out while we were measuring him, but one bark of 'keep moving and we'll measure you with our threads instead' made him settle down.\n3. Help Lessing finish all the new work our Professor gave him. Check! Outcome: Just so he wouldn't get worried, we sat him down nice and firmly, and finished up each piece of unfinished work one by one in front of him so he could see. We asked if he was satisfied or not after each piece, and he said he was very satisfied. Phew! We've definitely taken some of the pressure off him now. What a great little cohort of big siblings we are.\n4. EXTREMELY good news! Our Professor's just informed us he's giving us a vacation—he's off to study on his own and wants some peace and quiet. Now we can completely unwind! Quick, tell Lessing!\n—Hold on, what is he drawing his sword for?\nThe Doctor told Lessing that the Liches were asking if he could just head over to Kazdel once in a while, and that apparently they had no plans to subject him to the Professor whatsoever. So, off Lessing went on his journey... only for him to be subject to quite the odd series of events. As you'll see—\n1. The Liches have never been so eager to invite me out for food. Did they screw up in front of the old man somehow, and now they want me to deal with it?\n2. The Liches scrambled to get me a whole new set of clothes. They clearly screwed something up and they want me to deal with it.\n3. The Liches are doing <i>work</i> for me! This is unheard of! Whatever this screw-up was, it was <i>not</i> small!\n4. The old man went and disappeared! Was this really so bad it even impacted him...?\nSurrounded by a bunch of positively gleeful Liches, Lessing habitually pulls the bindings on his body tight, readies himself, then comes out brandishing his greatsword—\n'Are you done? Go on. What are you trying to get me to deal with?'\nWhen Fremont comes back specifically to fetch the little comb he uses to preen his beard, the sight that greets him is thus: Lessing's greatsword whistling through the air, his bindings totally loosened and free-flapping. On the other side, the young Liches trembling and cowering in the corner, asking in a quiet voice, 'S-S-So are you destressed and decompressed now...?'\nLessing looks at the panic-stricken Liches, then casts a glance at the presents strewn all about the floor, and now, finally, it clicks in his head what today was all about. He props his greatsword under both hands, and heaves a long and deep sigh. '...I suppose I am.'",
