From this, one can imagine why Bison displays such maturity and reliability despite his years, and the hard work that went into that. Bison's addition to MDL undoubtedly paved the foundation for the cooperation between MDL and Rhodes Island. He also temporarily worked in Penguin Logistics, and made invaluable contributions that set the stage for good relationships between the three parties.\nIt is often said that were it not for Bison's reliability and responsibility in spearheading the logistics industry, some Operators would continue to use the 'Penguin Logistics method' to complete their work. As a result, we must give thanks to Bison for his efforts.",

Whether conducting external operations or conducting consultations on civil work, Bison's thoughtful actions have greatly benefited both Rhodes Island as an organization, and young Operators who see him as a role model.\nHowever, those who have known him longer will point out that it is not hard to see his more na√Øve, adolescent side. Though scarcely seen, Bison will unabashedly show his fascination towards the world in the face of the scenery of the North, the Laterano Church, or the wide deserts of Siracusa.\nBefore his father founded MDL, the young Bison accompanied his father through countless different lands. Perhaps at that time, the desire to become a transporter had already taken root within his heart. However, after the establishment of MDL, more and more responsibilities were piled upon his head, giving him no room to breathe - until he met Penguin Logistics.\n'It sounded like an interesting turning point, but after working with them, the gulf between us felt impossible to describe with words.'",

In the 10-or-so minutes of the meeting, Mr. Eurill's topics virtually all revolved around the topic of his son.\nHowever, Mr. Eurill seems to be very satisfied with Bison's current arrangements with Rhodes Island. For whatever reason, Mr. Eurill seems to have no intention of bringing Bison back to MDL - as a matter of fact, he doesn't even want his son back at his side too early.\nThe only time was when Mr. Eurill invited Bison to visit his mother, who had only just returned from treatment in Lungmen. The overly formal letter drew a sharp contrast with Mr. Eurill's daily image, making it seem as if this wasn't a family letter at all.

The day he succeeded, concluded communications, and walked out that glass door, the eternal lights of the skyscrapers drew his shadow long, and it was only then that Bison realized it was late at night.\nLaterano. At the street corner where the structure above him collapsed with a boom, Bison caught a dessert that almost hit him in the head in his shock. The grand church briefly stole away his senses with its splendor under the sunlight. Soon after, he pushed the door open, where the Legati were sat to capacity inside.\nColumbia. The never-resting pioneer cities gave him a profound respect for humanity's sheer vitality, and the bleeding-edge science made him pore over every clause and turn of phrase in the contracts all the more carefully. Across from him sat several execs, and Bison was alone at the front of the desk.\nSami. He once tested his own disposition and momentarily set foot in the tundra, but unfortunately the youngster's willpower was hard-pressed to bear the might of nature. As Bison huddled in a blanket in the lodge, sipping hot water, a melodious singing voice reached his ears from outside the room. He crawled up to the window, and made a rough note of the lyrics.\nSiracusa. The sandstorm in the barrens tore the map he was holding to shreds, and Bison had to make it to his destination bar going by the lights alone. He pushed the door open, and the three Lupos inside fell silent. He coolly handed over the goods and info, and turned a blind eye to the cold glint of a firearm peeking out from under the blanket.\nYan. He's back somewhere familiar, and familiar too is the party that awaits him again as he enters. Bison recalls his surprise last time candy rained down on him from all over, but now he sees the chaos before him and simply takes the shield his redheaded mentor hands him, now in a very peculiar form indeed, making it hard to tell its original design was of his father's own style.\nHe uses the calm and coolness he's trained on the journey thus far to look as unflustered as possible, but all the charm from across the land flashes across his brain in an instant. Mixed with the music is an explanation to the rough tune of 'We were running a delivery and hit a snag, so we just grabbed it to save our hides. The mods were to make up for that.'\nBison accepts it, this present from his father, and plunging through the tunes and the scent of apple pie, he makes his way to the bar counter and begins to write a reply.\nTitle, greeting, main body. He inquires about his father's health, and writes of how his recent work has gone. He lifts his eyes to see champagne flying at the face of some unknown gang's goon, and Bison swiftly tucks the letter into his pocket and raises his shield.\nIf one day, he could take complete charge... on one hand, Bison is trying to reckon with what all these bells-and-whistles modules are even for, and on the other, his mind is looping the thought that he's going to make this place run like an orderly, regular business for just one month!\n...No, dream bigger! One year!"
