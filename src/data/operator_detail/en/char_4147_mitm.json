I was born and raised in Kazdel. Spent most of my time as a street peacekeeper. They call me 'Consultant', but I don't get paid for the job. I didn't know much about Rhodes Island, but Nymph and Mudrock said it's a nice place. In terms of pay and benefits, I mean. Can't stay on the ship for too long, though, or all hell will break loose back home. Plus, I've gotta be your eyes and ears there, don't I? That's what you pay me for. Well, that's pretty much it. I've never written a 'personal statement', and I don't know how.'\n\n[Classified Log]\nOperator Mitm's personal statement shows that he continues to be guarded towards Rhodes Island.\nInformation from other sources in Kazdel indicates that he has never met his birth parents. The origin of the name 'Pohl' is unknown, but it has been seen etched into one of his daggers. The blade, which originated from Columbia, is of low quality, the only advantage being the low cost.\nPohl began monitoring any faction that has any dealings in Kazdel very early in his 'Consultant' career, including, of course, Rhodes Island.\nHe receives regular reports on comings and goings from the smugglers that roam the lands outside Kazdel, and any new faces are shadowed by orphans within the city, who also report to him. The information network he has built far exceeds the scope of his role as so-called 'street peacekeeper'.\nWe should perhaps reassess the motives of this slum 'Consultant' in joining Rhodes Island, and the potential risks of allowing him access to confidential data.\n\nNo need to blow things out of proportion. I've heard about him from Nymph. He's just a kid who's had some hard luck. Leave him alone.\n—■■■",

They're really clean and there are papers from everywhere. I want to figure out how these things are made, and then I'll start one in Kazdel myself ;)\n\nThe day after Operator Mitm was reprimanded for violating the Living Area Hygiene Convention, he was given a blank newspaper subscription application that listed all the newspapers that Procurement is able to supply. Rather than immediately fill it out, he studied the newspapers he had scavenged and came to a disappointing conclusion: Starting a newspaper is about more than just writing. It requires a large amount of paper, ink, and printing machinery, not to mention the manpower required to deliver the newspaper to households. Kazdel was not just missing a newspaper, it was missing the infrastructure to support one.\n\n'I used to think that the people of Kazdel needed a newspaper so that they'd know what's happening inside and outside the city, making it easier for them to go about their day. But now, I realize that newspapers are just a vehicle, and it's not the only way to pass on information.'\n'What are you planning?'\n'I'm gonna set up loudspeakers by each furnace node, and broadcast the news I learned to nearby residents. Still hammering out the details.'\n'Sounds like a good idea. You can request the necessary items from Logistics and Procurement. I guess I'll take this subscription application form back...'\n'Hey, not so fast! I'm filling it out. Two copies of each one, one for learning how to write news, and one for teaching the kids in Kazdel how to read. That's not against the rules, is it?'\n'No, but do you have enough room in your suitcase for all those newspapers?'\n'Worst case, I take less clothes and a few more suitcases. Not a problem.'",

            "storyText": "Cherry-3, often believed to be an imitation of a popular Columbian remote recon car, was in fact invented by Mitm after joining Rhodes Island. He can only claim credit for the original idea, however. The actual blueprint, as well as the custom parts used, was mostly the work of others.\n\nI was taking a break in the Engineering's kitchen that day after spraining my ankle. Operator Mitm came in and said he had a golden opportunity to get rich. When no one paid attention to him, he said he had a cutting-edge research project. Still, no one paid attention to him. Finally, he sighed and said, 'I guess Engineering's all about theory and not practical tech. Guess I'll ask Logistics instead.' That got everybody's attention. I didn't really listen to what he was saying, but the gist was that he wanted a remote car that can fight, but all he had was a hundred LMD and some scrap metal. Everybody turned around and left, and I was the only one left in the kitchen... You're wondering why I stayed? Like I said, I sprained my ankle. He thought I was up for it, and so he grabbed my hand and thanked me profusely, talking about being 'pioneers' and 'industry-leading'. Well, I guess I fell for it. By the time I realized it, it was too late. I'd already said yes.\n—Interview log with Operator Humus, Engineering Department, joint inventor of Cherry-3\n\nDespite a rocky start, Mitm and Humus were able to build a prototype. Though Mayer's connections, they sold the rights of the Cherry Recon Car to a Columbian businessman at a handsome price.\nSurprisingly, Mitm handed the proceeds over to Humus, saying that he only supplied the idea, and that it was Humus who did most of the work. Humus gladly accepted the funds, which allowed him to finally begin the development of his 'automatic eating machine'.\n\nLet me reiterate that Cherry-3 is not related to the Columbian Cherry Recon Car in any way, nor is there any concern over intellectual property infringement whatsoever. First, their names are different. Second, Cherry-3 was designed for educational purposes; all of its functions have been designed with education in mind. You are aware, of course, that the environment in Kazdel is not at all friendly to kids who wish to study uninterrupted. Which is why the machine's been fitted with early-warning, deterrence, and limited self-defense systems. The all-terrain tires and solar panels provide it with the necessary mobility and endurance. Oh, this button? That's the self-destruct button. You are aware, of course, that the environment in Kazdel... ahem. Anyway, I've no intention of putting it out to market at this time, so our colleagues in the industry need not worry.\n—Interview log with Operator Mitm, joint inventor of Cherry-3",

That encouraged him to sit down and talk to them.\nMost of these children were born in Kazdel, and some of their parents are still assisting with the city's rebuilding project. They had heard from Operator Odda that the famous 'Consultant' of Kazdel had come to Rhodes Island, and came to hear his stories between treatment sessions.\nMitm did not let his guard down, and embellished his stories with outlandish episodes in an attempt to interfere with the nonexistent 'investigator'. He soon realized, however, that the children eagerly took in even his most absurd stories.\nThey covered their ears in fear when he talked about how he escaped a mass grave by digging a hole with a knife; cheered when he talked about how he scared away bandits who were looking to plunder food; and wept when he talked about how he led emergency repairs for a collapsed furnace node, never letting go even when it burned the skin off his arms and chest. When a teary child brought him a jar of burn ointment the next day, Mitm decided to stop deceiving them.\nHe told them another story, of a Sarkaz orphan who learned to lie, learned to protect himself with a knife, and somehow became someone that people listened to without really meaning to. Even with all the respect, however, whenever he went to bed at night he dreamt of the walls collapsing and everyone berating him with tears in their eyes. He thought the children would be bored, but when he looked up, there were the same eager eyes as ever, waiting for him to continue.\nIt is hard to say when Operator Mitm truly let his guard down, but it must have been after he told that story.\n\nLater, Mitm asked Odda why the latter sent the kids to him. According to Odda, his answer was—\n'Because you're a kid, too.'\nMitm denies that this conversation ever happened.",

For Sarkaz in trouble, owing 'Consultant' a debt is often preferable to the alternative, which usually ends with somebody getting stabbed. Only Pohl knows how many names are on the Consultant's ledger, and it is one of the reasons why otherwise desperate outlaws still think twice about getting on his bad side: A single entry is worth somebody's life.\nPohl has set aside the Consultant's rules at Rhodes Island, where he has taken up the code name 'Mitm'. Here, he is the one who is uneasy about owing someone. Logistics operators in the cafeteria put on a little more gravy when they see the scars on his hands. Busy technicians set their work aside to help him clear spurious warnings from his terminal. And when he stands in bewilderment before the myriad goods on the procurement center shelves, a passing operator might recommend Mama John's vinegar-pickled cherry candy to him.\nAt first, Mitm thought he was somehow showing weakness that he should not, but after making adjustments to his tone of voice, his expression, and even the way he talked, he came to the conclusion that helping others came naturally to the people here.\nOn the eve of his return to Kazdel, Pohl cooked a pot of Sarkaz soup for the operators who had helped him.\n\n'You're one heck of a cook, Mitm! I haven't had fin soup this good in ages. Do people in Kazdel use fresh fins to cook soup too?'\n'Hah, no, fins are hard enough to come by in Kazdel, no one would waste them in soup.' Mitm scoops out a ladle-full of beans, mushroom and dried vegetables, and puts it into the operator's bowl.\n'These vegetables can make a soup that tastes like fin broth, and it's just as hearty as the real thing. Even better with fresh vegetables instead of dried ones. Want another bowl?'",

An operator selecting daily necessities cannot help but worry as they look at Mitm's bulging shopping bag.\n'I've got a few coupons about to expire, so I need to use them up,' Mitm says, pushing an overflowing shopping cart from behind the shelf.\n'Whoa! Look at all that stuff! I'd better check out now—I don't want to be stuck behind you in line.'\nBy the time Mitm reaches the checkout counter, a crowd had already gathered there, waiting for the show.\nThe logistics operator at the register looked fully prepared. 'Bring it on!' they cry.\nThe scanner beeps nonstop, as the total amount on screen keeps zooming skyward.\n'Your total is... 997.5 LMD!'\n'Hold on a second...' Mitm says as he reaches into the inner pocket of his coat.\n'Planning to pay with your personal operator points? The 5% discount has already been applied.'\nThe crowd offers scattered applause, though the logistics operator shows no sign of relief. He knows the battle has only just begun.\n'Is that so...' Mitm pulls out a large stack of vouchers, all in different colors, from his coat. 'I'd like to use these coupons too, please.'\nThe onlookers begin to murmur with excitement.\n'Limited-time anniversary commemorative discount vouchers, new operator breakfast vouchers... these ones have expired.' The logistics operator carefully sorts through the stack and pulls out the few invalid ones.\nThe scanner beeps again, but this time, the number on the screen begins to drop steadily.\nFifteen minutes later, it displays '103 LMD.' The logistics operator finally smiles. 'Still above 100 LMD. Ha.'\nMitm frowns, scans the area, then fixes his gaze on the clock across from him.\n'Add this.' Mitm picks up a pack of gum and hands it to the logistics operator. 'Also, it's just past 8 PM—after 8, fruit and deli are half-price.'\nThe logistics operator's smile freezes. The number on the display flickers, settling at 84.75.\nThe crowd erupts into cheers.\n'Wait!' The logistics operator isn't ready to give up yet. He eyes the shopping bag hanging from Mitm's tail. 'What about that big bag? I haven't scanned anything in it yet!'\nMitm's expression changes. 'These are personal items!'\n'No, I saw what's in it! A big box of cystymilk and some detergent... that's at least 30 LMD—I haven't lost yet!'\nThe logistics operator lunges forward, while Mitm swings his tail, sending the shopping bag flying.\nThe box of cystymilk spins in the air, the hinge on its side flipping open to reveal hidden blades; the detergent bottle opens wide, revealing a remote-controlled car and an energy reserve unit inside.\nFor a moment, a torrent of blades and metal tools flies everywhere...\n'I told you, they're my personal items!'\n'Who would hide dangerous items in milk cartons and detergent bottles?! Can't you use a normal toolbox like everyone else?'\n'It's called 'camouflage'! If I carried a toolbox, even a kid would know there's a weapon inside.'",
