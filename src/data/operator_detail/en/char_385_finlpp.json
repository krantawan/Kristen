Even though she knew a little bit of Originium Arts, she has never experienced the cruelty of bloodshed or the sorrow of lost lives. This cheerful and lively personality may make her easy to get along with, but earning the trust of others is a much higher hurdle.\nBack then, very few people understood the importance of the 'environmental conservation' that Purestream was always talking about. After all, between Catastrophes, Oripathy, and Reunion, there were too many threats that were considered more imminent.\n\nBut after Purestream quietly cleaned the waterway around the area Rhodes Island was stationed as well as handling the after-treatment of Rhodes Island's sewage in the process, some sharper-eyed Operators began to understand - this youthful water treatment worker may not be so good at combat, but the work she does do is more important than anyone would expect.",

Purestream's hometown is a small, simple village located close to a river. Famous for its pure, clear water, this village has retained many customs that reflect the simplicity of the past. Catastrophes rarely affect this area. Relatively isolated from the outside world, the people here have not had exposure to the Infected, have little conception of Oripathy, and are not wary of outsiders. When asked by our investigators about these subject matters, they were quite open with us, viewing these issues as no big deal.\nWe found that Operator Purestream worked with Rhodes Island personnel to resolve an issue involving an Originium discharge causing downstream pollution in this local river. After this incident, she became the talk of the town, with many seeing her as a bringer of good fortune. Apparently, she felt the limitations of her own abilities during this incident, and decided to contact Rhodes Island with hopes of expanding her horizons.",

In severe cases, allergic reactions, chafing, or other related symptoms may occur. Therefore, Purestream always carries a small spray bottle of purified water with her. She can often be seen taking out this bottle to spray water over her face. Rhodes Island's well-equipped bath facility has quickly become one of her favorite places.\nPurestream holds herself to strict standards in the conservation of resources, her conviction only faltering when it comes to her bathing problem, for which she appears ashamed and apologetic about.\n\nFor others, this is perfectly understandable, for nobody is perfect. Despite that, Purestream has expressed remorse for her actions and has even set up a rule that limits her to three baths a day.\nBecause of this restriction, she makes sure to thoroughly enjoy each session. When she completely submerges herself into the water, the young girl is so happy that she sometimes can't help but to sing.\n\n[Classified Records]\n Regarding Operator Purestream's race, it is difficult to find out where they originated from, but we may be able to glean some clues from some local folk songs.\nHer true hometown must be very far, far away, in a distant land.",

It was only a little thing I bought while carrying out a mission in Yan, but the local said it'd been blessed at the temple. Someone tells me I can go and ask Purestream. Purestream... I'm not too familiar with the name. Maybe it's a new operator handling lost and found at Logistics?\nIt's not in my dorm...\nOr the meeting room...\nI find her at the baths. She's just finished repair work, and now she's—well, bathing. I can even hear her singing from outside the door. It's loud, clear and perfect... but don't you feel icky bathing for that long?\n'Sorry, sorry, I know I kept you waiting.'\n'Rhodes Island's sewage work is up to the task, but they've really been overlooking cleaning the filtration system itself. The vast majority of areas have blockages. You need to get into them frequently! All I can do is hang on until the whole cleaning job's done before I... heheh.'\n'Is this your charm? Come and take a look.'\nThe girl absentmindedly talks as she opens a bag. Aside from my talisman, I can see marbles, hair clips, test tubes, and even an ammo magazine...\n'Did you... find all of these in the sewage filtration system?'\n'Yup. It was covered in mud when I found it, absolutely filthy, but I've already thoroughly cleaned it.'\nI'm about to ask 'how could it have gotten there,' but I hold it back. I should be asking myself that...\nLater, I'm chatting with a friend in Engineering about the landship breaking down and getting repaired. Nobody would've called the problem being the sewage systems. Operator Purestream took on the cleanup task all alone after only a day of her job, and she'd spent two whole days inside the filthy inner filtration system... blockages in a few specific areas were the 'main culprits,' all the 'treasures' we'd accidentally lost and couldn't find. I remember Purestream sort of shyly smiled when I told her thanks, and she just urged me to 'take care from now on,' giving me a precautions while she was at it. Water could flush everything away, so we'd gotten used to just twisting taps and pushing on valves, simple as that. It was precisely because water could flush everything that we never knew how dirty it'd gotten, somewhere out of our sights.\nI hear Purestream's in charge of Rhodes Island landship sewage work now. I didn't know what she liked, so all I could figure was to buy some scented soap and send it to her. I only found out later she'd gotten piles of it by that point. I guess I wasn't the only one who wanted to tell her thank you.\n\n—As related by an operator, extracted from a periodic evaluation of Purestream following her onboarding",
