Many mature schools of Originium Arts share similar methods of inheritance - for example, Leithanians use movements, the Sarkaz lead through ceremonies, and various guilds of Arts practitioners conduct research, all for the purpose of passing down the theoretical and practical components of Originium Arts. As one of the traditional Originium Arts originating from Yan, Lei Fa has a deeper history than most other forms of Arts. As a system shrouded in mysticism, the requirements for practitioners of Lei Fa are also restrictive and physically demanding. Its inheritance system gradually evolved into a solemn ritual of sorts, much like the passage of power. The end result was that Lei Fa tacitly became synonymous with the position of power, subsuming the popular symbol of law enforcement, and even becoming a form of self-cultivation in the quest for spiritual transcendence. As for rumors of the physical basis of 'transcendence,' I can only say that as an Originium Arts researcher outside of Yan's cultural circles... I must harbor a healthy amount of skepticism.\nObviously, Leizi exhibits a degree of pride for the Arts she uses.\nAccording to some officials, when she taps into her powerful Originium Arts, her hair will become very smooth. Though I don't know why, I can scarcely imagine anything more worth investigating...\n--R.V.R., Caster Operator\n\nI must question your priorities...\n--12F, Caster Operator",

To be honest, the whole reason Rhodes Island is able to survive the tempestuous conflicts among various city-states is that in addition to the confidentiality and necessity of our line of work, maintaining political neutrality is essential. This is accomplished by balancing the benefits afforded to different city-states, negotiating with government representatives, and trading favors - and although these actions are necessary for the survival of Rhodes Island, the less we have to do, the better. An empire's government officials appearing on board Rhodes Island's ship, regardless of their position or rank, is almost always a dangerous matter.

No amount of paper can contain a fire, and no matter who made this decision, this is definitely a bad move.\nSomeone with years of intensive training, representing a major political playmaker, is now walking around freely on the ship...

            "storyText": "[Sixth Record]\nWe consider ourselves lucky.\nSome Operators, such as Skadi or Shining, don't seem to care at all about this issue. The fact that they can focus on their goals and practically ignore all the rest of the background noise is good for their work.\nSome others are concerned, but are just keeping silent about the matter. For example, Ansel brought up the issue several times, but decided against it each time and left after dropping off some snacks. They've struck a good balance between curiosity and their sense of responsibility.\nOr, they simply don't know anything about it. I once witnessed Cuora getting lost and ending up in front of Leizi's dorm, only to have dinner with her before being sent back to Block A. Cuora will recount how they had four main dishes that night as well as a soup, concluding that Leizi is a very nice person, end of story.\nYet another type is those who have already been bound up and silenced, not even uttering a word about the matter even if tortured. Yesterday, I caught Blaze slacking off while I was on duty. Even though this time it was basically just bureaucratic busywork, and Blaze tends to use this time to get some rest and relaxation, she actually ran over to the intelligence room to go over files with the person who complains most often about her work ethic - Leizi. Amiya, who was standing at the doorway, even vouched for them before apologizing to me and pushing me out. She still had that faint smile as she waved me goodbye.\nSome of us are definitely going crazy, and I've begun to suspect that it's actually me. Having that said, this proves that in addition to gathering data, Leizi has a vested interest in 'maintaining amicable relationships with her targets.' While it's true that she hasn't done anything yet, she also has been concealing her whereabouts from the rest of the world.\nAt first, I interpreted her application for long-term board as a form of rhetoric. In that regard, I admit I was in the wrong. It's just that to write this whole thing off as 'improving relationships' is far too suspicious.\nHow ironic. Concealment and deceit have turned into a method of expressing trust, and turning a blind eye in order to coexist together has become the new norm.\nFortunately, the great powers have not turned their gaze upon Rhodes Island just yet, a neglect which has already saved us several times.\nOf course, if she was trying to spy on us, it would be stupid to walk in with an official state-sponsored identity. But that is precisely why we cannot rule out the possibility, and must do our best to maintain confidentiality and control the information going out.\n\nTo be honest, she is very good at her job. A pity that she is not one of our Operators.\nI can actually make some inferences about what happened to her before, and it's entirely understandable why she seems to be in a rather odd state.\nPerhaps now, the only proof of her true self is that tone of voice, and her golden locks that flow like electricity. I believe that she is in a self-imposed exile as a result of this case.\nNo matter where you are, there is a price to be paid for being selfless. If you fully dive into this cause, you will also give up your future. However, now that I think about it, surely the Central Judicial Office has no shortage of such personnel?\n\nI admire her courage and perseverance fleeing here by herself. That would be a reason to shelter her even if she didn't pull her weight.\nThe hardships that she must endure from here on out, and the path that she must take, may yet be unknown to her still. No, I'm sure she knows full well, but simply has chosen not to act upon it.\nSome people believe that those who work in the judiciary have a strong moral compass, and everyone can see that on display. In Leizi's case, she readily apologizes if she is wrong, and never toots her horn when she is right. You will never be able to get someone like her to stop bowing her head. It's a part of who she is.\n\nDespite her many virtues, a glaring blemish is her attitude towards the Infected. By the looks of things, this is not something that can be changed in a short time.\nHowever, just as day and night eventually blend together, I trust that a day will come when she understands the plight of the Infected. After all, she needs our help as well. I heard that Leizi spoke of a certain time in Yan, or a certain season... something involving the spring's first roar of thunder. The spring thunder is supposed to penetrate the darkness of the long winter.\nI'll look after her, provided I don't get pissed off to all hell by those who are keenly interested in her personal belongings, like Haze and Rope.",
