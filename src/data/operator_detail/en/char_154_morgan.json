Apparently Indra, who had practically set up camp in the training grounds and fought like a beast possessed, was sent over by this dark-skinned Feline.\nExpecting this group of city slickers to obey the rules probably wouldn't do him any favors.\n'Hello, Operator Morgan. These are the rules for using the library, so please be mindful of them when enjoying the facility. But do not worry– for operators with special circumstances, we have a more personalized approach to handling matters.'\nIn one breath, the librarian recited the script that had been prepared long in advance, while internally greeting the coworker taking over the next shift again and again.\n'Perfect! Actually, I had a list of books here, but couldn't make any sense of these codes!'\n'Why of course– that's our personalized approach to... Huh?'\nThe librarian obviously didn't expect for this Feline to hold up a list of books taller than herself. The handwriting on the list was unmistakable - after all, the well-reputed Ursine lady it belonged to was already one of the library's regulars.\n'Are you sure about this? These are all fairly dense historical documents.'\nHe immediately regretted his decision the moment those words left his lips, and quickly took a step back.\n'I'm looking for some inspiration for my new book! My friend told me that the stuff on this list might have what I'm looking for, completely different from that hogwash I had to read to show my merit to those musty old aristocrats.'\nThe librarian finally breathed a sigh of relief. It seems that what his colleagues in the training grounds said were all rumors, and that Glasgow actually had educated people who could follow the rules. He then set down all the books he was holding in shame, before enthusiastically helping Morgan search through the collection.\n'If you guys in Glasgow need it, I can help you apply for a library card with more privileges so you don't have to run back and forth all the time.'\nThe librarian admired this thoughtful Feline from the bottom of his heart, but was so enthusiastic that he didn't notice the sly smile on the corner of her lips.",

The demolition crew from the toy factory on the corner is under our protection now, but I would've preferred that they never showed up.\nBaird and I still don't know how to console Vina. Why's she so down all of a sudden?\n\n[April 4th]\nWhat's going on with Hannah, that dolt! Why hasn't she figured out the problem yet? Apparently, she sent one of Ryan's distant relatives to the hospital, so they probably won't be messing around on our turf anymore.\n\n[■■■■■]\nThis joke's not funny anymore. I have no illusions that scrappy old Hannah's gonna sit down in the gym with us and listen to us all day.\nVina's worried about the rough plan that Baird and I came up with. Hopefully Hannah can accept it without too much fuss. (If not, Baird said she'd be in charge of holding her down.)\n\n[April 15th]\nHannah's already been busy for a good half month in preparation for that one day. Vina's well aware of the prank I'm pulling on Hannah, but also doesn't have the heart to let her down after seeing how hard she's been working. So, Vina's cooperating with me to put on a little show, and avoiding Hannah for the time being.\nHowever, her worries are gradually becoming realized. More and more logistics companies have been pulling out of Norport Borough, and I heard the last few staff members maintaining the railway are also about to be transferred away. Rumors have also been going around that there've been lots of foreigners out and about the borough, so we can't wait around much longer.\n\n[■■■■■]\nHaven't seen the boxing gym this busy for quite some time; just about everyone and their mothers showed up. Everyone was hollering Vina's and Hannah's names, and I couldn't help but place a little bet on the long-awaited duel between them.\nOf course, Hannah, who had conquered just about everyone in Norport, was certainly qualified to challenge Vina again, but reality can often be cruel. At least, seeing them both in the ring again made me not feel so guilty.\nTomorrow's the day we leave. Hannah unexpectedly didn't have any issues with Vina leaving Norport Borough.

She knew that she would need some time, so she took the initiative to drag the visibly agitated Indra to the back.\nDagda also stood silently behind Siege as always, neither too close nor too far.\nMorgan surmised that Siege understood this too – that Glasgow's members had more or less figured out her true identity, just that the gang's leader hadn't yet figured out a good excuse to broach the subject with everyone.\nAll along the direction of the railroad tracks, Glasgow saw the once-bustling factories and logistics stations, now all deserted. From within their shelters, a few homeless people watched this procession from nowhere with vigilant eyes. Just ahead is the checkpoint to Sudean Borough. Many homeless people gathered in front of the checkpoint to look on enviously at the construction team going back and forth on the other side, but the impassive border patrol squads cut off any hope of them slipping into Sudean Borough in search of a new life.\nMorgan had seen this play out before. When she was young, the homeless people outside Norport once looked upon their brand-new homes with such envy.\n'Can't pass through that checkpoint there. I know a way out of Londinium from Auchterigg Borough.'\nThis was Morgan's first time setting foot in Auchterigg in her life. She quickly discovered that even the loud and brash Indra could only keep her mouth shut in shock at the scene before them. Time has left an indelible mark upon this section of Victoria's most historic area, but the tranquility established by its construction has still been preserved to this day.\nNow, this was civility.\nSuch was the first thought that crossed Morgan's mind. She even hoped that she could live here, among civility. But, the faces of the homeless people back at the factory floated into her mind's eye and made her shudder.\nWhat is it that keeps 'civility' alive?\nIt is all of them, and all of her people.\nThe fate of Norport Borough is also the fate of Sudean Borough. The cycle of prosperity and recession means nothing to the people living among civility. The fate of the outer urban areas will never be more than a lingering afterthought to the 'civilized.' Food will always be food, even if the brand changes.\nSomehow, Morgan ends up at the end of the line, and seems to notice the regretful look in Siege's eyes.\nThough she has countless inspirations to put pen to paper at this moment, she nevertheless does not know where to start.",

We used to be a bunch of street ruffians, and our biggest battles were fought in the underground black market. But things are different now. All of Londinium has become a battlefield, with enemies we've never seen before and an unimaginable number of casualties. This isn't anything like a street brawl! I try hard to put on the same airs as before and become a pillar of strength for them, but the truth is, I also need a pillar of my own.\nVina? That's right, Vina. Vina, who led me through hell and high water in the fight for our survival, is that pillar. We've had similar experiences and grew up under similar conditions, so Vina should understand how I feel...

Anyone would do the same. I'm just worried that she'll be pulled away from us by the people she fears and loathes, while I'm powerless to protect her. After all, I'm just a lowlife who grew up on the streets. What ability do I have to fulfill the promise I made to the girl who wandered onto our turf?\nChowder? When'd she learn to make chowder?

Damage to the cinema hall was relatively minor, and the altercation was determined to be non-fatal. Due to the intercession of McClaren, the cinema hall's owner, the court decided to hand down a lighter sentence and had the Glasgow members detained for three days. Morgan, a member of Glasgow, paid for the bail, and Howard, a former trainee in the police force, closed the case.\n\nCase Review Application: An outsider died half a month later due to serious injuries. Because the deceased was a resident of Auchterigg Borough, the Royal Police Station of Auchterigg Borough filed an application for review and requested for an officer from Headquarters to supervise the investigation.\n\nCase Review Description: [Confidential]\n\nReview Results: Howard, a former trainee police officer, deliberately contradicted the officer in charge of supervision and assisted Morgan, a member of Glasgow, forge important evidence. Suspected of helping Siege, the leader of Glasgow, and under suspicion of interfering with the review process, he was removed from his post and taken into custody at Auchterigg Borough Headquarters.\nMorgan, member of Glasgow, voluntarily submitted relevant evidence and surrendered herself as the only participant in the malicious incident. Due to insufficient evidence, the other Glasgow members retained their original sentences.\n\nA vague note on the back of the file reads:\nAs a notice to all officers who access this file, the review decision has been forwarded to Headquarters for processing, and I am not authorized to accept any appeals. And just to be safe, I don't want to hear anyone in the police department praising Morgan or any other Glasgow member. This will land you in serious trouble.",

      "desc": "Something's definitely new about the Slobberknocker's sign.\nBack in the gym in the lockdown zone, Morgan's first order of business is to check the sign hung over the entrance, with Vina's blessing. The shoddy paint has bubbles trapped in it, and the big 'Slobberknocker' that's been carved is definitely a cleaner job than when Hannah first had a go.\nInside the big lockbox under Morgan's bed rest her dearly beloved Morgan's Memoirs, still safe and sound. After triple-checking it hasn't been touched at any point, she pulls out the good tipple stashed alongside, takes two honking swigs, then chokes and starts hacking and coughing.\nPast its best-by date, but still. If it was a good tipple, it's always worth a try.\nNow fretful, Morgan looks through the pile of old cruft in her box. Something's missing.\nBut it turns out to be a page that's fallen out of her Memoirs, and just a quick skim is enough for her to remember all the details.\nThis was back when their old neighborhood friends weren't taking the Glasgow Gang's biz seriously yet. No denying that Morgan's ideas then were absolute rotters from time to time, stuff like getting outsiders to buff up the gang's standing. Who knew she and the one-track mind Hannah would hit it off so easily? And so they went about harassing plenty of youths from Victoria's other parts.\nUntil Hannah was humiliated at the hands of she who protected those youths, Vina.\nThat was the first time Morgan heard Vina's name, more than a decade ago. Hannah just kept pestering Morgan to talk this 'outsider' Feline into joining the gang. Went as far as talking about 'protecting the neighborhood toy factory' and stuff like that as a front. Shame the Feline in question wouldn't fall for that.\nWhat narked Hannah more was when some noble's servant from the city center came to mess with the toy factory for whatever reason, both she and Morgan tried to stick their heads out for the neighborhood and took a horrid beating instead. And then in the end, who but Vina would show up and shoo the two out of there.\nHannah came back and spent that entire afternoon in a huff. After making a big show to Vina that blew up in their faces, she'd never agree to join now. But to the surprise of both, that night a Vina covered in wounds ran up to the gym cradling a huge box of local specialty toys, banging away on the door.\n'From the toy factory's owner. This way everyone'll know the factory is under Glasgow Gang protection.'\nMorgan made fun of Hannah about it for ages afterwards. The dumbstruck Hannah and the visibly impassioned Vina would become the principal heroes of the Memoirs in time.\nAnd it's ever since then that Morgan's decided deep down to protect Vina. After all, everyone knows the poncey lords doomed themselves by messing with Central.\nIt's there that Vina, wearing a perplexed face and holding a rusted toy, interrupts Morgan's reminiscence.\n'I found this in my room. Do you remember whose it is?'\nMorgan finally twigs what was missing from the box. Up in high spirits, she slings her arm over Vina's shoulders.\n'Let's go ask Hannah. She might know.'\nAt least nobody's changed.",
