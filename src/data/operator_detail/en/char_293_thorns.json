After spending more time together, everyone gradually realized that though the Iberian swordsman may seem cold in demeanor and speak in a blunt manner, his actual nature was rather straightforward, free-spirited and suave, though not overblown. \nThe swordsman seems to be aware of the issues some may have with his blunt and easily-misunderstood way of speaking, but he isn't particularly bothered by this. For Thorns, others' perceptions of him are ultimately inconsequential, and the way the outside world evaluates him has no effect upon him. \n\nThorns often delves deeply into the extraction and preparation of medicinals and ends up ignoring other things in the process — such as his own outward appearance. Forgetting to wear a jacket, having one trouser leg rolled up, wearing clothes with holes in them, and even wearing things backwards or insides out — all of these are commonplace occurrences. If you encounter Thorns in the hallway displaying one of these features, don't read too much into it. \nFor a swordsman who pursues precision and efficiency, it isn't worthwhile to spend too much time maintaining one's appearance. Even if Thorns' hair puffs up and curls over because of an awry experiment gone explosive, Thorns continues to conduct his own business, withstanding the curious eyes of all bystanders without a care.",

            "storyText": "Thorns' swordsmanship is extremely potent. According to him, his particular style of swordsmanship requires every single motion to be precisely calculated. This swift and precise technique is widely known throughout Iberia as the 'Destreza.' \nThe mainstay weapons of the Iberian region have always been swords and knives, with a wide variety of techniques spread across the land. However, the technique known as the 'Destreza' is not accessible to everyone. Needless to say, this technique requires excellent physical fitness, but it also has extremely demanding requirements for the user's mind. These strict requirements make the technique very difficult to learn, but if mastered, the rewards are great. \nAt the same time, many traditional Iberian blademasters believe that 'Destreza' can only be used to describe swordsmanship using a standardized subset of weapons; and in their eyes, the styles used by non-Liberis, including Thorns, are nothing but clumsy and blasphemous imitations. However, according to Thorns, those people have absorbed more than enough of the technique's framework and apply them in a more realistic manner. On this basis, there are no issues with considering them as users of 'Destreza.' In other words, people who fight over semantics will quickly perish when they have to actually cross swords. After, they would not be exclusively facing swordsmen. \nHowever, even these renegade swordsmen will readily admit that Iberian swordsmanship is as vast and as dangerous as the ocean. No swordsman may ever exhaust that knowledge within his lifetime; not to mention, that lifetime is generally very short as well. \n\nIn any case, by combining the precise swordsmanship he has mastered with the deadly poisons he concocted himself, Thorns will always complete his missions upon the battlefield with efficiency and ease, ensuring optimal results while keeping losses minimal. \nHis method of operating is beyond reproach in terms of efficiency; however, in many situations, Thorns himself ends up garnering criticism. \nThorns' swordsmanship and his pharmacological knowledge were learned from a local priest. He and several other children studied under the priest, following him through childhood and adolescence. Because this priest became involved in the religious turmoil that would later break out, several of his students have taken divergent paths. \nThorns is exceptionally skilled at swordsmanship, and also exhibits extraordinary talents in pharmacology. He is particularly skilled at extracting and purifying drug compounds, especially toxins. The precise efficacy of some of the neurotoxins he's produced has been praised by the members of the Medical Department. In addition, Thorns always has bolder ideas when it comes to refining other reagents; and while his experiments do sometimes yield positive results, they end with an explosion more often than not. \nEven in the face of failure, Thorns always seems to enjoy himself.",

An operator's profile overview can only be completed by synthesizing all of the available information. \nThrough these investigations, we've noticed that the personalities of the operators who come to Rhodes Island are almost always complex and multifaceted, almost impossible to reduce down to a list of simple traits, and never exactly the same between two operators. Of course, Thorns is no exception. \nMany people who've been in contact with Thorns will describe him as 'difficult to get along with.' While these evaluations seem to reflect poorly upon him, further investigation revealed that many of the operators who gave him these negative evaluations still maintain frequent and friendly interactions with him. Those who are able to see more and more of Thorns's flaws are, conversely, closer to him and have a deeper relationship. \nWhile people complain that Thorns is 'difficult to get along with,' they still make the effort to do so. In regards to the issue of Thorns' interpersonal relationship with other operators, we concluded that there is no need for further monitoring. \n\n[Addendum] \nI agree that long-term observation can enhance our understanding of an operator. \nBut to be honest, I originally thought he was kind of cool, but within a few months, all I could think of was him and his.... uh... how should I put this... lively operators doing all kinds of weird exercises together. They'd talk about wacky topics all day long, and then try to actually build that stuff. Sometimes, their crafts will explode before even being finished! Who's going to be able to keep an eye on a guy like that? How come no one has come to hang these people on deck yet? \n\n[Recorder's Addendum] \nWe already tried that, but it didn't do anything. \nThe investigation period ends today. I have some comments I'd like to write on this file, but my boss said they were too subjective, so nevermind. What I will say is, the potion bang snaps they made today were a lot of fun.",

Occasionally, when you mention their homeland, even Iberians who are generally impassive or stony-faced will show some complex expressions, and these subtle nuances can reveal a lot about their attitudes. \nThorns is one of the few people among us who actually will give an unreserved impression of Iberia. Compared with the silence or vague remarks of the other operators, Thorns actually can give a calm response to our inquiries. He's provided us with a lot of referential information, and while a lot of it is fairly similar to more mainstream conceptions, some of it completely subverts these notions. \nIn the past, this seaside country was often associated with passion, vitality, indulgence, where sunshine melts into the coast along the horizon. Once widely known for the resplendent beauty of its golden sunlight, this country was often discussed in conjunction with Laterano because of its religious connections. However, in recent years, this rich land has gradually become silent and faded from the public eye. \n\n[Classified Log] \nVery little is known about the current state of Iberia. According to Thorns, the treatment of the Ægir in Iberia has gone from bad to worse over the past few decades. He described a once prosperous city as gloomy and stagnant. \nThe local administrators do not seem to prohibit locals from leaving, but they have enacted tight restrictions on re-entry. Rhodes Island's investigators have been staying near the area for a long time, but have not found a way to conduct an in-depth investigation. \nThe Investigation Department has reached a similar assessment, discouraging any attempts to rashly enter the area until the need arises to prepare for an in-depth investigation.",

I bring to you the brine of that place!'\nThe next to seek an audience was an alchemist, shrouded from sight and of age unknown, yet bearing a treasure he wished to present.\nBut before the king could decide whether or not to trust this figure, the alchemist appeared within his hall.\nHe asked the king to give him the hourglass and the flask, and the king readily agreed, curious as to what he would do.\nThe sand from the ends of the land melted into red liquid before his eyes.\nThe brine from the ends of the sea crystallized into white sand before his eyes.\nThe alchemist scattered them both nonchalantly, and they seemed to dissipate into thin air. As if responding to his will, a strong wind blew through the kingdom for three days and nights.\n'I know not how vast the land or the sea are, but regardless, neither are as vast as Iberia's boundless power.'\n'From now on, the winds of the land and sea obey your will, O King of Iberia.\n'Starting today, see to it that a fleet is built, and follow the direction of the wind.'\n'Be it by land or sea, Iberia's fleet shall show the way.'"
