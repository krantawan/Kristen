Her ancestors immigrated from Kazimirez long ago, but kept a form of cultural practice that predates the popularization of Kazimierzian knighthood. Despite growing up in Victoria, Grani wore Kazimierzan armbands, showing her fascination with Kazimierzan knights. \nThe mounted police was one of the law enforcement agencies present in Grani's hometown. It included officers from national, county, and city police forces. They are known for their well-practiced operations and broad jurisdiction. \nGrani was younger, shorter, and smaller framed than her teammates, which was a subject of some ridicule from other officers. She found herself handling busywork and other trivial tasks, kept away from serious law enforcement. \nHer first job was to help a citizen find a lost wallet. She ran through the streets, checking every alley, asking everyone she came across, until she finally recovered the wallet from a gang member. \nGrani never cared that her work was trivial, and she never sought promotion. She just wanted to patrol the town and help people in need. \nBefore long, the Mounted Police received a letter commending her efforts. Soon, a second letter came. Then a third, and even a public award. But when the people became accustomed to Grani's work, the stream fan mail slowed down.",

During one such deployment, she fended off a large group of interceptors threatening the convoy. \nThe list of her impressive accomplishments is long, given her lack of experience. \nGrani once lost contact with her combat squad while clearing brigands from a mountainous area. The complex terrain wrought havoc with their communications signals. \nWhen the squad finally found Grani, she had ran the bandits off on her own. \nShe took the initiative when fellow Operators could not arrive before the raiders began looting a village. She devised a plan to buy time, using the town streets and houses to mitigate the attack. She eventually forced the bandits to give up. \nHowever, when she went to rescue a child kidnapped by an outlaw, she took a hit to her left arm. \nAfter returning to Rhodes Island, the Operators discussed her course of action: 'She continued pursuing the enemy, but did she violate the directives of the operation?' \nThey came to the conclusion that while she did break some rules, without her efforts, the mission would have failed. \nGrani made the right call.",

Today, she's finally gotten an official assignment, doing something the mounted police should do—she's joining in the escort of a criminal.\n'Uhh! Not that I'm saying unlocking things isn't what a police officer should do... just...'\nIt's just that she finally gets to do something she's dreamt of since the beginning.\n\n'We've been attacked by an armed group, and we're low on heads! Division Three requesting backup!'\n'How are you, Division Two? Send two for emergency support! Hold on until HQ get here!'\n'It's Grani's team... She shouldn't be taking assignments like this...'\nThe fleet transporting the convict come to an emergency stop under the sudden attack, and though they're prepared for this, the numbers they're facing still exceed the mounted police's expectations.\nGrani holds a defensive posture behind the escort vehicles, the convict still inside, held by a teammate—they're not letting the door open again under any circumstances, as per code, so no worries about the subject.\nAfter that comes devoting everything to prolong the ceasefire as long as possible, waiting for support.\nBut her superior's words just now get Grani a little mad. She's heard words to that effect more than enough times, yes, but today's her first time on an official assignment, and she thought that was recognition of her ability.\n...Guess it wasn't.\n\n'All you need to do is stay here and defend the vehicle, and wait for us to sort this out.'\nGrani watches her two seniors run in armed against their fire, and they take down one, two... even more of the enemy appears from behind the bunker, shouting 'There's only two of them!' and rushing... her seniors and teammates suddenly fall, they pull their hands from the wounds they were clutching, and Grani sees palms red with blood.\nThe parked fleet creating its own highly useful bunker, Grani conceals within it and launches charge after charge. Her teammates have lost hope until they see her routing the enemy's formation, and they're hauled back into safety one after another by this pint-sized girl. The opposition so much as beats a retreat for the time being.\n\n......\nThe support squads following up take over the task of escorting the convict, and Grani keeps her injured seniors and teammates company on the way to a nearby hospital for treatment.\nBit by bit, she's been changing the way people see her, and though she's never rejected herself, getting the recognition of others is something that pleases her all the same.\nGrani dusts off the badge on her shoulder, a bit of ash stuck to it from the conflict before, and now it glimmers bright."
