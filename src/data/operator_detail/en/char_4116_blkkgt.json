My predecessor was there, that's how I heard about it. As for what happened in the end... She probably only had a few minor injuries by the time she made it to the city gates. \n'It was basically spitting in the faces of those big shots, so naturally, they couldn't just let her go. So they ended up bringing the Darksteels into the fray. Of course, all they could manage was getting her to leave her trophy in the city. \n'As for what came next, you know as much as I do. She met a noble from Kjerag who bought her, and from then on she had nothing to do with Kazimierz. I used to envy her when I first heard the story, but not anymore. \n'I'm serious, Doctor. When I found out you had connections with the president of Karlan Trade, I was already expecting this day to come, but— \n'Um, could you ask if she has any... <i>issues</i> with the Armorless Union for me? If so, I'll think I'll be hiding in the rafters when I see her going forward—though I doubt that'd help much.' \n—Excerpt from a conversation between Platinum and the Doctor",

After her meal, she will go out if Master Enciodes has work for her, or if there is Tschäggättä training to conduct. Otherwise, she will exercise in the yard for about two hours, then copy scriptures or read in her study until noon. She then goes to the nearby commercial district for lunch. \nDuring her lunch break, villagers will often approach her, asking for help with farm work or to settle some trouble (there is a consensus among the locals that her help is first-come-first-served), and what's most astonishing is that she will agree to help them after eating. You could say she spends most of her afternoon helping the villagers, and on the rare occasion she has free time, she will head to the snowy mountains in search of something more exciting. \nUsually, her dinner is willingly provided by the villagers who borrowed her assistance, or she'll simply have something on the road. Then, she goes for a stroll by Lake Silberneherze before returning to her residence and calling it a day. \nYes, Miss Degenbrecher, the living legend who left an unbroken record in Kazimierz is now living the simple life here in Kjerag. This only whets our curiosity about her attitude toward life, but she was unwilling to share her opinion. After the writer was hung by a wooden pole on the wall outside her residence, we were forced to take a different approach. After interviewing some random neighboring villagers, we have selected a few valuable comments from them. Hopefully, our readers can get to know her better this way. \n\n 'Degenbrecher? She's a good person! Just ask around, there's no one here who hasn't received her help! You definitely have to write that down. No clue what this Kazimierz thing everyone keeps mentioning is, but she's definitely a good Kjerag girl!' \n——An old man enjoying the shade under a tree \n'Miss Degenbrecher? Oh, she's an honorary member of our Anglers Association. At first, we thought someone like her wouldn't be interested, but one day she spent the entire afternoon with us by an ice hole, and it was then I knew she was one of us. Go ask the fellas who're always at Lake Silberneherze. Everyone knows her, she's our idol.' \n——A young angler \n'Degenbrecher? To be honest, I was wary when she first joined us. After all, she pretty much took my position. But afterwards I stopped caring, yeah? Spend long enough with her, and you'll realize that despite how she looks, she really does care, deep down. There's no doubt she's an indispensable member of the Silverash family.' \n——An Itra with a strange scent \n'Can Kjerag can satisfy her? That is but the preliminary question. You will soon discover that what gives her cause to leave or stay is not the satisfaction she feels, but whether her environment makes sense to her. I am pleased to note that Kjerag does indeed, and I believe her attitude towards it represents a sort of simple, yet sharp, perspective on this place. I can only hope that she finds the future Kjerag just as coherent.' \n——A Feline who asked to conceal his identity \n.....\n——Excerpt from the March 1098 issue of 'Kjerag Newsletter' second edition",

It was an interesting experience for her, and she realized for the first time how she could simultaneously wrestle with nature and have fun. \nSince then, you could always find her in the rescue team whenever an avalanche occurred in Kjerag, and as such she has become a hero to many of the locals. \nHonestly, I'm only trying to entertain myself, she thinks. \nThese days, Kjerag's avalanche warning system is more than sufficient. The day before one occurs, the monitoring center sounds an alarm to warn the residents and pedestrians at the foot of the mountain to evacuate, and the mountain is closed to everyone and anyone—with her as the sole exception. \nWhen she sees the locals watching her walk into the snowy mounts with surprise in their eyes, she thinks she did not come here to win or lose. \nFor her, there is no victory or defeat against an avalanche. After all, what even counts as a win? To survive? If so, then naturally she's on a winning streak. But if requires her to cut down her foe, then she has never once succeeded. \nBut this does not dishearten her, for she finds it quite enjoyable to challenge something she cannot defeat. Besides, as long as she lives, she can try again and again. And perhaps one day, she might just succeed? \nEven so, the Kazimierz knights had regarded her as an insurmountable wall, and not just that. Once they concluded she was unbeatable, they gave up entirely on trying to score a victory, with their bouts somehow ending up about testing their skills against hers by the number of blows they could take before falling. \nA wave of white snow rises from the mountaintop and rolls downward. \nShe looks up, thinking of Enciodes and his hooded friend. \nShe thinks that what they face is just like the avalanche in front of her, or what those knights saw her as. \nShe pulls out the swordbreakers stuck in the snow, and launches herself towards the wave. \nThey always seem to make the same choice as her.",

So many were so insistent that she became a little curious. \nAs a result, the Leithanian dark horse tried out many of their aspirations—their corrupt, intoxicating, infeasible lifestyles—she has tried it all. \nShe has also met those with so-called nobler inclinations. \nBut in doing so, she carefully realized that all their desires ultimately boil down to keeping themselves or the people around them alive, and to have a good meal afterward. It was then that she decided that Kazimierz did not hold the answer she was looking for. \nAnd so the nation's champion chose to be exiled. By the way, the GCC probably still doesn't realize that if they hadn't sought her out, she'd never actually planned on winning a third time. \nThe conflict with Darksteel did indeed introduce unprecedented danger to her, and at the time she had two thoughts. One was to ask Darksteel what kind of aspirations someone as strong as them might have, and the second was that if her skills were lacking, then there really wasn't anything wrong with dying on the spot. Kazimierz was just that boring. \nIn the end, neither happened, and instead she met a young noble who claimed to hail from Kjerag. \nYou seem to be curious about how Enciodes convinced me to go with him at first. It was nothing special, he was just the first person I couldn't fully comprehend. And now, there are many more like him around me. \nI don't understand you, Enciodes, or some of the others on this landship any more than you understand me. \nYou may find it hard to comprehend that I lack any aspirations, but do you people really have something you're striving for? All you do is to piece together the wishes of others into a huge fortress, then convince yourself that building it is a dream of your own. \nLet's say I ask you now, what do you want to do? Can you think of anything that isn't just realizing the desires of someone else? \nIf you could trade your life to realize your dream, people like you probably wouldn't hesitate for a second, as if you were born just for that. \nI've seen too many avaricious people drown in their own desires, as well as too many tragic deaths of those who did no wrong and only wanted to live. I've also seen many who managed to realize their desires and obtain the life they aspired to. But people like you, I've yet to see how your lives end. \nAnd that's why I chose to go with him, and why I stand before you. \nJust do whatever you want, and I'll make sure you live.",

She stands up in the originally unremarkable living room, and looks around to confirm she didn't miss anything. \nGoing to Rhodes Island is just a relatively long vacation, so there shouldn't be a need to bring anything special, she thinks as she plans to take a final look at Lake Silberneherze from the window. \nAs she walks across the floor in the middle of the room, her footsteps make a different sound than they do elsewhere. Hollow echoes remind her there is something beneath the floorboards. She pauses for a moment. Of course she knows what lies underneath—the hilt of a greatsword, the very same one she used in Kazimierz. This also brings back a few memories of the past. \nDuring her escape, the weapon was actually broken in two after blocking a Darksteel arrow. Back then, she threw the blade in reciprocation and took the hilt with her—after all, she had no other weapons then. Until she arrived at Kjerag and got her swordbreakers crafted by the Karlan Trade artisans. Naturally, she stopped using her greatsword. \nAnd as for why, she once told Sharp that it was because Kjerag was too cramped for it. She often repeats this to others while imagining a future where she might need it. Which is why she decided to stash it under the floorboards in the first place. \nHowever, she realizes now that even on the night she knew she was about to face Kjerag's biggest crisis yet, it never once came to mind. She had completely forgotten it existed until today. If not for her coincidental footsteps, she might not have realized it even after arriving at Rhodes Island. \n'I suppose if Kjerag was too cramped, then Rhodes Island might not have space for it either.' \nShe thinks for a moment, then suddenly chuckles for some reason before walking towards the window. \nShe will probably never need to use that greatsword ever again.",

After making exceedingly short work of her operator exam, the remaining downtime was spent with her enlightening our HR operators as to their significance.\n- Knight-Champion of Kazimierz Medal\nBlack medal of crossed swordbreakers, lying unassumingly in center of case. Design makes it immediately clear that Kazimierz tailored this champion's medal to her. She reigned for three straight years and so was given three, but only the first was personally awarded to her by the Grand Knight after usurping the defender. Which is why she didn't throw it away, and why it's the one artifact of Kazimierz she still carries with her.\n'Commemorative enough, barely.'\n- 'Thanks'\nInverted triangle inscribed with Kjerag's holy Mount Karlan. Not issued by any official organization, rather forged for her by clan head Ratatos at the request of a household under Browntail rule. Degenbrecher had rescued said household's members from an avalanche.\n'This first one was almost ten years ago now. I know they meant it nicely, and I don't mind how it looks. But the news spread, and now I get one of these medals from the Tri-Clans any time I do something similar. The cupboard at home is full of them.'\n- 'The Silverashes' Sword and Shield'\nSecond medal from the left, sword and shield motif. All of Karlan Trade knows that those wearing this medal are free to act unimpeded wherever Karlan Trade is concerned. Initially a pass designed expressly for her by Enciodes, but as soon became apparent, nobody simply overlooks the presence of Degenbrecher. Its worth these days is instead in gently reminding others that she is affiliated with Karlan Trade.\n'One day, I forgot to wear this one. Enciodes went that entire day quieter than usual, then in the end asked if I had any complaints with the company.'\n- 'Kjeragandr's Soldier'\nThird medal, honorary decoration issued by the Vine-Bear Court, was worn by Enya herself when she formally became the Saintess.\n'This was the biggest protest the Saintess could make back then. I don't think much in particular about Kjeragandr—at most, I think I'd like to take Her on.'\n- '10 Years'\nTo mark ten years of acquaintance, Enciodes rustled up a little gift for her, effectively commemorating her Karlan Trade decennial at the same time. It may not have been founded when they first met, but the blueprints were already laid out in his heart.\n'I didn't even recall what it was commemorating when he gave me this. A token of thanks, I suppose, but I'm sure he just wanted to let me know that he still remembered the big words he said back when it all began. Speaking of Kjerag... if you're ever there as a tourist and want to find somewhere quiet, you can ask me.'",
