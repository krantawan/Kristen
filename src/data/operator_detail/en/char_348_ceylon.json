Independent city-states, however, are.\nIt should be said that in the context of the present day, the social collectives referred to by 'nation' were city-states in the past. The predecessors of several nations were independent cities gathered together. Additionally, even today, some nomadic cities that nominally belong to certain nations still to varying degrees retain the customs and traditions of the city as opposed to those of the nation.\nHowever, it must be conceded that the concept of an independent city is falling by the wayside, although the old-fashioned and elderly might refuse to admit it. That is because the concept of a nation is more powerful.\nNow, even though there is still a considerable number of independent cities on Terra, their leaders have already recognized that independent cities are no match for nations. In recent years, there have been many such independent cities that have surrendered to neighboring nations.\nHowever, Siesta's special characteristics may be able to take them in a new direction.",

In fact, the discipline of Originium Research has a large number of sub-categories, both in the applied area of the doctrine as well as the theoretical. Ceylon specializes in researching the history of applied development of Originium. \nBefore the modern academics managed to specialize the research, many precious historical materials on Originium were not well preserved. In fact, collecting clues from past historical data to infer the paths of development of the various Originium schools was also an important part of modern Originium research.\nAlthough today, with the development of science and technology, the study of historical materials has gradually become less concerned with the development of theory and more the verification of it. Of course, the importance of recording history itself is self-evident for the meaning of a civilization.\nNaturally, although Ceylon has only just graduated from university, her intellectual reserves and enthusiasm for the study of Originium is breath-taking, and one can clearly see how much effort Ceylon put into her studies. For Rhodes Island, the addition of such an outstanding talent is a most unexpected surprise.",

Words cannot be used to sufficiently describe the depth of feeling they have for one another.\nHowever, one point that may be worth recording is that while they regard one another as the most important thing in each other's lives, their worlds are not merely limited to one another.\nCeylon still eats with other researchers, works with them, and can argue theory until the wee hours of the morning. Schwarz can independently carry out her tasks as well as hit the taverns with other mercenary operators and engage in hand-to-hand combat with them in the practice area.\nThey both have their own independent lives, and after joining Rhodes Island, they expanded their horizons even more. We can intuit that they will become more accustomed to this life while still remaining as important to one another as they've always been.\nThis could be described as a 'profound mutual affection,' with emphasis put on 'profound.'",

The student shuts her book.\n'—Elevated BOCD, no signs of Oripathy.'\n'Ceylon Doykos. Elevated BOCD, no signs of Oripathy.'\nThe three let out a collective sigh. 'See!' the student starts to tell the other woman in excitement. 'I'm fine, Professor!'\n'More like you're lucky,' the professor replies sternly, shaking her head.\n'I've warned you two before. Outdoor investigations are to be carried out within stipulated safe regions, during designated times, and proper protective measures have to be taken. Without specialized protective gear, coming into contact with highly activated Originium is exceedingly dangerous. Moreover, we have no right to extract ore from the mines. The mines can hold you liable for anything you've done. Ceylon, you're supposed to be a model student.'\n'But I want to verify the theories I see in my textbooks... and besides, if I hadn't warned Mr. Davis and the others to halt their work, there would've been an acute infection incident. I couldn't—'\n'What if you'd judged wrong?'\nCeylon stops in her tracks. After a moment, she droops her head. 'Sorry.'\n'I'm not expelling you, but you will have to retake this course,' says Ceylon's professor says as she gets up from the bench. 'It was only your first field outing. Be mindful of properly protecting yourself in future.'\n\nOnce the professor has left, only then does the mine-worker nervously move to say a word of thanks.\n'Thank you for saving us. I don't know if we've burdened you... Your professor sounds like she thinks you did the wrong thing.'\n'No, not at all,' Ceylon replies with a smile.\n'I know what my professor thinks. She just has to teach me these things as part of the course. I need to know fear, and the worst case, and I have to weigh whether the responsibility's something I can take.'\n'It's when I learn all that that I can truly make my own choices.'",
