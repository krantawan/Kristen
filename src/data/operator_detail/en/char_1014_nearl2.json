Aside from a change in weapon-of-choice, her application of Originium Arts is no longer constrained to treatment. There's no doubt her swordspear wrapped in gold remains the ultimate deterrent to enemies on the battlefield.\nJust as her close friend Shining says, 'In the days she roamed with us, Margaret learned how to hold herself in, but upon her return to Kazimierz and reprisal of her charge, the Radiant Knight's learned how to blossom with all her heart.'\nIt's not just Shining and Nightingale; other operators who've worked with Nearl are shocked by her changes, but they all agree they suit her. Everyone understands clearly that in the application of justice to evil, so long as both reach the limit, the spotlight must shine. Immersed in the Radiant Knight's rays, evildoers are seared and burnt, while justice's allies continue supremely uplifted.\n\n[Weapon Evaluation]\nThe swordspear Operator Nearl now uses, like the warhammer before it, was given by the Nearl family to a Kazimierzian craftsman to design and forge, and has been strengthened by Operator Blemishine. It was at one point broken in a bout between Nearl and the Blood Knight, only for Operator Blemishine to mend it again.\nBy Rhodes Island's Engineering Department's evaluation, Nearl's swordspear goes beyond the strength of Kazimierzian campaign knight standard arms, making an incomparable fit with Nearl's own Originium Arts. Under ideal circumstances, it gives the Arts she casts an almost 10% increase in effectivity. By request of the evaluating engineer, Nearl obtained the consent of the weapon's designer, and authorized Rhodes Island to create a 1:6 scale model of this swordspear, residing in the Engineering Department, provided for any engineering operators and students to research.\nSupplement: Don't let Closure know how much a high-precision model of the Radiant Knight's swordspear could sell for in the Grand Knight Territory. Our agreement with the Radiant Knight says there'll only ever be one of these models.",

Still, she never refused a single time the Rhodes Island Kazimierz Branch Office sought help. In her heart, whether she's aboard the landship or not, she remains a part of Rhodes Island.\nThough admittedly, she has very limited time to stay aboard. For operators who admire Nearl, or perhaps miss their time fighting side by side with her, it really is a shame. At one point, many new operators full of hope sought out Instructors after finishing watching Nearl's Chernobog Incident battle records, mentioning wanting to learn a thing or two from this valiant operator, only to come back disappointed after learning Nearl was on long-term leave from the ship.\nIn contrast to Nearl, after Operator Blemishine confirmed her sister was on track with her undertakings in Kazimierz, she threw herself straight into the landship workshop, and spent a very long time without returning home. After several days in a row of Blemishine being unaccounted for, Nearl 'happened to' return to the landship, accurate in finding her in an experimental workshop working on the latest defensive materials, and seizing her while she was right into the middle of passionately hammering away with Eunectes. Nearl learned soon after that Blemishine had been hard at work on all-new form-fitted armor for her.\n'It's softer, and lighter, so you can wear it when you'd normally wear leisure clothes, or underneath your formal gear, and it's gotten a massive boost to defending against physical impact! I asked Mechanist and Sona to take a look, and they both said, if I just worked at it a little more, this armor would be able to block it the next time a Lazurite arrow—'\nSeeing Blemishine's brilliantly glowing face despite the circles under her eyes, Nearl didn't reprimand her for overtaxing herself, but instead hugged her close.\nBy Nearl's own request, this meeting was saved to this archive file. She hopes it'll serve to remind her that her every act in Kazimierz bears not just the weight of its manifold sufferers' hopes, but involves her most beloved family's future. The Radiant Knight now no longer launches lone charges against the great waves. She even extends her thanks to Rhodes Island, because she clearly saw the magnitude of the change that life aboard Rhodes Island brought to Maria and Zofia—'Just like when I had first joined Rhodes Island.'\n'Of course, we have to give our own thanks to Nearl! Without her, we wouldn't have pulled in such outstanding operators as Blemishine and Whislash, right? Not to mention Flametail Knight, and the whole other crowd of operators who came from Kazimierz... The Radiant Knight's personal charm really is the best recruitment ad! If only a certain few of them didn't obsess every day about when she's going to come back so they can have a fight with her.' —Melancholies of a certain operator from HR",

The plots veiled and open, both on and off the stage, the glinting of blades from the city's tip to tail, and the blood and sweat that Nearl herself shed in the field, all recorded in fine detail in the Special Operations Records. Anyone who's read through these records, or talked with Nearl before, will have no misconception of Nearl's attitude to this competition. After the span of six years, two champions, a long and treacherous path, and all manner of hardship, the Radiant Knight of today, same as the one of the past who attempted to shatter the rules that shackled, has never recognized the honor of knight competition championship as true glory.\nHowever, in Nearl's eyes, there is another side to this farce.\n'In that arena devoid of any splendor, every heroic moment bursting forth is splendorous; in those streets lit by neon that fall short of truth, the fellowship that comes together to survive is true; in those video recordings lacking any honor to speak of, those thirsts to clamber out without relenting, to break through oneself, are honorable.'\nLate one night, Nearl wrote these words in her Rhodes Island cabin, imagining that once her friend in the City of Saplings and Artisans received this letter, they might ridicule how out of place her rare lament seemed, and let out a smile alone to herself.\nThe next day, she came across a young operator excitedly calling for 'the Radiant Knight,' to ask her her signature. The Radiant Knight's path to retaking the championship had been the focus of masses, and even Rhodes Island had its fair share of her fans. She'd keep running into similar situations each time she returned aboard, but these excited fans would be warned and kept in check by Dobermann and other Instructors most times, this being no exception. What Dobermann didn't expect, however, was that Nearl would accept that competition photograph, and wrote a line of text on the back.\nAnd this is what she wrote: 'Keep up the training—Operator Nearl'.\nIf the encouragement of her signature could inspire a young operator for a good day, then, well, whether or not they truly understood the significance of her charge at the championship, at least for that day, it wouldn't matter.",

Considering her experiences dealing with different people over the past few years, she had a clear recognition of the difficulties she did, and would soon face. In addition, her history fighting side by side with Shining, Nightingale and the other operators of Rhodes Island made her realize that the necessary amount of cooperation makes much easier work of things.\nWith the joint efforts of her and all of Pinus Sylvestris Knightclub, Rhodes Island's Kawalerielki branch office was successfully established. At the same time, she set out on new work to settle the Infected. To progress her plans, she no longer operated in total isolation outside of Kazimierz society's mechanisms; on the contrary, separately with the Adeptus Sprawiedliwi and General Chamber of Commerce, she made collaborative strides in different places. As one of the legendary Nearls, and two-time Major champion, she had a clear and marked value at every Kazimierz conference table, just like every matter she wanted to bring to fruition, and every life she wanted to save. 'All things have their price'—the sole principle that modern Kazimierz pursues. Nearl was naturally disgusted with being shunted about as a weight on the scales, but she never minded how the Radiant Knight seemed in others' eyes. As long as she was sure, that sufficed: What she held fast to, what she brought back heart and soul to Kazimierz, were all priceless. No deals existed between her and the Adeptus or the K.G.C.C.; every cause willing to lend her a hand, she would grasp in turn, and every hindrance to her forward path, she would turn to face with swordspear in hand and no sliver of hesitation.\n'She's not like us. We'd have to look where we're going if we didn't want the wheels barreling our way. And her? She doesn't care about what turns at her. She'd opt to crash straight through it. No matter if we can't keep up, no matter if where she goes makes her presentable or not—once she smashes out of the cage, we all get to see the light coming in.' —Flametail Knight's stirred thoughts after several times cooperating\nIt's true. Without fear of danger, Nearl will forge on for the sake of a single, for a few Infected, but however many she's saved isn't her point of satisfaction. Countless idealists are ground to dust by the monolithic wheel of their times, forced to change themselves midway through changing others, but she is forever on the road, one time after another, launching her charge against the raging waves.",

This goes to show that as far as Kazimierz is concerned, the Nearl couple's whereabouts are classified to an untouchable degree.\nThrough discussion, we discovered Maria has near to no recollection of her parents, while Margaret's memories of them end at ten years old, give or take. From this, we understand that they went missing at least a decade ago. To Margaret's memory, outside of being cared for by her grandfather, she was often in the company of campaign knights. Clearly, following her parents' disappearance, the Adeptus Sprawiedliwi were considerably assistive of her family. This further shows with high likelihood, the Nearl couple went MIA in a major Adeptus-launched mission with close ties to Kazimierz.\nAre they still alive to this day? If they did give their lives, then what dangerous affair lost Kazimierz a pair of such outstanding campaign knights? Doubtless we could find some answers in Kazimierz's top secret archives, but raising this matter would have an adverse effect on our relationship with the Adeptus Sprawiedliwi.\nIf you wish, we could still continue looking into this. Supposing there comes a day we find one of the Nearl family pursuing the issue, whether it's Margaret or not, we will be willing to offer our assistance.",

      "desc": "Margaret, clad in a full suit of armor, clutches a wooden swordstaff in hand, focusing her attention on confronting the man in front of her. \nThe wooden sword swaying gently in his hands reveals no hostility at all, but Margaret knows that if she lets her guard down even for a second, that sword would bypass her swordstaff and lightly tap her on the head. \nUsing the range advantage of her swordstaff, Margaret repeatedly probes her opponent. As usual, her opponent momentarily leaves an opening for her, and she seizes the opportunity and thrusts forward with her swordstaff.\n'Well done, Margaret.' Schnitz Nearl falls to the ground, pretending to be helpless, lying there as he smiles and shows his daughter a thumbs-up. \n'Father...'\nSince she began her combat training, Margaret has rarely landed a blow on the man.\nBut this time...\n'Did, did I do it right?'\n'You did. You did a great job, Margaret.'\n'Do you think you can help me up now?'\n'S-Sure. I'm sorry, Father.' Margaret hurriedly sets down her swordstaff and grabs her father's hand with both of hers, using all her strength to pull him off the ground. \n'A good showing, young foal. Now even your father is no match for you.'\nMargaret's mother, Yolanta, appears at the training area's entrance carrying Maria, who is still a baby, in a swaddle blanket.\n'Haha, you should've seen how much momentum she had behind that last thrust.'\n\n'Mother, what brings you here?' \nIt is late at night, but Margaret sees that her mother is neatly-dressed and carrying a suitcase, as if getting ready to go out.\n'It's almost time, Schnitz. Put yourself together.'\n'Alright, give me five minutes.'\nThe father takes off his training pads, revealing the suit of armor underneath.\n'Mother, Father, where are you going?'\n'I'm sorry, my child, but we can't tell you.'\n'Just imagine we're heading up north to buy you some souvenirs.'\n'A-Are you going to be gone for a long time?'\n'Yes...' Margaret's father is deep in thought for a moment. 'It might take a bit of time.'\n'So, can we ask you for a little favor, Margaret?'\n'I'm listening, Mother. I promise I'll do whatever I can!'\n'First of all...' the mother squats down and hands the sleeping Maria to the young girl. 'I'll need you to take care of your little sister and your grandpa.'\nThough Maria was not heavy at the time, when Margaret held her, she gripped her carefully for fear that her sister would fall from her arms.\n'If you have any questions about combat techniques, you can ask your uncle. He has much more experience than your father does.'\n'Yes, Father...'\n......\n'Is there anything else you want to say?'\n'That's about it.'\nKnock, knock, knock––\nSomeone is at the door.\nShe feels each knock pounding at her heart, striking her with fear.\nHer parents are about to leave.\nHer father readies his swordstaff, and her mother readies her bow. Margaret follows them to the door.\nWhen it opens, two campaign knights in silver armor stand before them.\nTo Margaret, they look like a pair of man-eating monsters.\n'Lord Schnitz, Lady Yolanta, we have instructions to escort you out of the Grand Knight Territory.\nThe parents agree in hushed voices, then turn back to Margaret.\nSchnitz hugs Margaret and Maria tightly.\nYolanta leaves a heavy kiss on their cheeks.\nMargaret stands in the doorway, watching her parents' figures grow fainter and fainter.\nThe whole time, she expected her parents to suddenly turn back to tell her it was all a prank.\nShe expected her uncle, who had watched her parents depart from outside the door, would go bring them back to the warmth of their family. \nShe even expected her sickly grandfather upstairs to rush down and drive away the troublemaking campaign knights.\nBut her expectations were dashed.\nHer pride and her sunlight slowly disappeared to the edge of the Grand Knight Territory, never to be seen again.\nMargaret feels an emptiness inside.\nAll she can do is close the door behind her and hug her sister tightly.\nNothing more.",

      "desc": "We find ourselves in the shadows, as it always has been.\nIt is midnight, and naught in the tavern but a dim light shines on The Radiant Knight's face. I recall when first we met... it was rare to see someone so composed, so at peace. That, Liz and I knew better than anybody. Here, her sister sleeps over her knees, muttering a word or two from time to time, but The Radiant Knight holds still, unstirring. Estranged for so many years, she elects, quietly, simply, to watch over her family. Whislash—Zofia—does not disturb the two. In fact, she combs Nearl's hair and tail for her. The Radiant Knight's locks are matted with blood, blood of the shadows. Shadows whose echoes are stayed outside of this bar, peaceful as it is, for a time.\nLiz is somewhat drowsy, but adamant not to rest. We have much to say to The Radiant Knight, to Operator Nearl of Rhodes Island, to Margaret. Fortunate or misfortunate it may be, but I am familiar with her entirety, her every part. Hence, I knew long ago this day would come. Hence, I've harbored since long ago this quiet hint of unease. Reluctance.\nI know we won't truly be parting. Yet we each have our own matters to face, and indeed, these matters are leagues unalike.\nMaria wakes, comes to find she's been sleeping on her sister, and flushes somewhat. Zofia makes sharp barbs, scolds the two on their less than model appearances. She is dwarfed by Nearl by some centimeters, and without realizing, always cranes her head to speak to her; the posture seems a strain. It <i>is</i> rude of me, but I cannot help scrutinizing Whislash's expression as she stands before The Radiant Knight. Is there defiance in what she feels? Does she long to fight alongside her, shoulder to shoulder? Does she place her ideals and convictions into this knight of flesh and bone?\nAnd how is it that <i>I</i> see Margaret? As... a companion of the Followers? We break bread together, suffer together, no part of us reserved. We...\nMargaret claps my shoulder. She tells me she's been wanting to borrow my ear herself. She's back home, back to Kazimierz, where she began. But <i>we</i> began elsewhere: in Kazdel, in Sargon, in Londinium... Our guilt, our tribulations, do not lie here. It has me curious then, very much so, about what those led to set forth by her light see when they lift their heads, and look to the dark night.\nA pang of regret strikes me. It makes sense; I've always detested my lineage, its supposed beauty something I've never tasted. Such love, such meaning in family, by all rights belong to her, and are to be celebrated and kept in sight. While by all the same rights, I do not belong here, and should find my own path. In coming here, her radiance will certainly be gone for a time from the tower that is her corporeal self, to see to the countless promises we made in the barrens, in the battlefield, in Rhodes Island.\nYes... Hence, I've given up on saying what need not be said. I smile silently back at her, and that is all.\nThe original sin of a Confessarius is not in a place of pure darkness. Light has been foretold.\nWe find ourselves in the shadows. This, in spite of each of our shadows' oracles being our own, each a different soothsayer.\nMargaret pushes the tavern door open, saying what comes to mind. —A knight should examine herself, survey herself, to discipline as disciplined. We must become our own light. Once we are set aflame, all will find that the shadows never bound them—\n\n—As it always has been.",
