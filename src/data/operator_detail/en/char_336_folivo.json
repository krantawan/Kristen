Therefore, it is totally understandable that she would trust her work partner more than others. \nHowever, Closure said one day that 'it's better to have someone who can talk with you,' and before Scene could refuse, Closure transformed Lens into a talking photography assistant. \nAccording to Closure, Lens stands out from the crowd. 'It contains the previous generation of Raythean Industries' auxiliary AI. All I did was give the little guy a way to express itself. There's nothing wrong with it becoming Scene's friend. After all, nobody else can understand what Scene is thinking. What is Raythean Industries doing anyway? Even if these have been discontinued, you can't just go around selling off stuff like this. In any case, this thing is very, very rare.' \n\nBecause of this, many people believe that Lens's habit of long-windedness actually comes from Closure. Operators have occasionally reported seeing Lens communicating with Lancet-2 in the hallway, but could not figure out what the whirring and buzzing was all about. Perhaps its built-in thinking loop actually functions like this, but this quality was put on full display after the installation of a sound device. As for what goes on in the little brain of a robot, sometimes not even the owner knows. \nDo you think that Miss Scene is ever troubled by... what happened to her old partner? \nAt least up until this point, I haven't received any requests from her to uninstall the sound device.",

This quickly pushed her out of the public school system, and since then, she has only received private education. As to why, the answer was obvious: 'Who would like to make friends with someone who takes the entire day just to say a single word?' \nThe isolation she had suffered through in the classroom began to spread outwards into her social sphere. Even though she was born into a noble family in Sargon, Scene has hardly attained recognition from anyone, let alone the upper crust. \nOf course, and this may be for other reasons, Scene seems to have been born with a natural insensitivity and was never put down by the harsh words of others. Even more fortunately, she found a job that she loved — Photography. \nVery quickly, Scene amassed her own fame and wealth, along with everything else that came with it. However, she remains silent and, other than occasionally taking pictures of high-ranking officials, prefers to do her work away from the commotion of crowded areas. \nWhile it is true that her shyness, almost 'mechanical' movements, and her statue-like postures when stationary have brought about social difficulties, these qualities have also been immense assets towards her photography career that ordinary people simply do not have. \nFurthermore, if you are fortunate enough to see Scene working on her own robotic camera team, you might think that her usual behavior is just a result of not liking to expend energy.",

All we know is that she continued to stay there, weaving a masterful tale about the unfolding of a Catastrophe with her camera. \nRegardless of what happened, at least Scene survived. \nAfter Scene contracted Oripathy, her parents consulted several medical organizations and finally decided to send her to Rhodes Island for treatment; however, they've never contacted their daughter since then. In the face of the somewhat complicated political situation in Sargon, this kind of decision seems almost natural to some operators. \nScene herself also doesn't seem to mind. Or if she does, she hasn't told anyone. \nIt didn't take long before she started to apply for the qualifications to work in the field, and even wanted to accompany operators to the battlefield in order to shoot more images. This means that Scene may be involved in battle, and possibly even lose her life. \nBut she didn't let that dissuade her. Lens is very proud to say that the places they've been to have been far worse than what people in Rhodes Island can imagine, and the dangers they've encountered are far more terrifying than what they now are dealing with. \nWhile Scene may have already honed her skills and be able to calmly face the doubts of others, another interpretation is that she might just be very dedicated to her trade. She believes that through her eyes and her lens, she can help others who are more sensitive to images than they are to words, just like her, see more and more of the world. \nScene very rarely says anything, but she did speak once with her dorm mates when discussing her family. She said, she believes in Lens, and deems the robot to be part of her family.\nAlso, she said that she believes in her parents. If her parents didn't love her, they never would've raised her in the way they did—\n'Everything we are born with in life is meaningful, but you are the only one who can discover that meaning. As long as you'll go do it, we will support you.' \nEven though Scene doesn't express it, she may perhaps be very happy now. \nBy the way, how did Closure manage to get a sample of Scene's voice to build Lens's audio library?! \n......\nWhat? Does Scene use Lens to speak for her sometimes? \nHmm, how do I know whether the one talking to me\nis Lens,\nor if it is actually Scene talking? \nIf I had to guess? \nLet's see.......",

According to the data stored in its program, you would at least need a cushion and an ergonomic backrest for something to qualify as a chair.\nHowever, if Scene has no qualms with this being a chair, then Lens is certainly in no position to complain.\n'How much longer?'\nScene asks in her usual, sluggish tone.\n'Only 200 meters more! We'll be there soon!'\nAlthough it had figured out what its owner was going to say long ago, out of courtesy and respect, Lens waited until Scene actually asked the question to reply.\n'Oh.'\nScene returns to her silence.\nThis morning, Scene noticed a small hill as she relaxed on Rhodes Island's top deck. Although it does not compare to Sargon's tall mountains, the path they are on has nothing but flat plains, making the unexpected mountain a sight for sore eyes for Scene.\nShe firmly believed she would be able to take photos of the most breathtaking sceneries on that hill.\nSo, driven by her impulse, she immediately had Lens take care of the paperwork and borrowed a car and a few helping hands to race to the hill. This is quite the urgent issue to her, it seems.\nAlthough there is still a ways to go before she reaches her destination, Scene has already started to think about everything:\nThe angle, the lighting, the colors, and the ratio.\nThese are questions that Scene is almost always thinking about as she goes about her everyday life.\nThis is her profession as well as her hobby.\n'We are almost there, Miss Scene. The destination is right ahead, past those rocks! But neither the cameras nor I can climb any further. I am afraid you may have to walk the rest of the way.'\n'Okay.'\nScene slowly slides down from her 'chair.'\nShe readies her camera and slowly makes her way up.\nStep by step.\nBit by bit.\nThe sunlight at last reaches her eyes, revealing the world before her—\nShe still remembers how warm the sunshine was as it lands on her cheeks and how cool the breeze was as it brushed her arms.\nShe remembers the fowlbeasts' melodies, the fragrance of the flowers, the crudeness of the rocks.\nThe greenery extends endlessly until it reaches the blue sky.\nRays of lights pierce through the clouds up above.\nScene is always working on the composition of her photos in her head.\nYet when the scenery actually opens up before her eyes, thinking only serves to distract her from the task at hand. All she has to do is chronicle the view before her faithfully.\nRaise the camera and press the shutter button.\nThat's all photography involves—\nAnd what an enjoyable experience it is.\n*Ka-chick*.",
