You have no cause to worry.'\n'That ain't the problem here... aw, forget it, whatever...'\nTo sum up, once Kafka's exam results came out, under Silence's very firm demand, she ultimately agreed to stay at Rhodes Island, and in the end became an Operator.",

One could say, as someone with gang dealings far and wide from childhood, she caught onto a survival philosophy of her own. That philosophy's embodiment—playing the good kid.\nShe absolutely does not care if people hate her for this mask of hers; really, it might make her happy. She doesn't want to be adored by very many, nor is she planning on adoring very many herself. This painstaking pretense is, as she sees it, the optimal tool for maintaining her sense of distance from others.\nIt's clear this approach stems from the day-to-day affairs of the gray zone—betrayal, deceit, bloodshed.

Her attitude towards the Doctor is a similar twist, one we can pry into for limited insight.\nKafka and others like her will often avoid getting in too deep with any one person, as they'd be unable to maintain their mask. Plainly, though, as an Operator, Kafka has no way of avoiding frequent contact with the Doctor, and in the course of this, she understandably has times where she drops her own act.\nGoing by the Doctor's observations, Kafka's inherent nature doesn't surprise too many—in truth, to our many life-weathered operators, Kafka's pocketful of tricks barely does her justice—her personal loyalty, her strong empathy, her living in the moment, not letting the future grip her.\nThat is her, and if she considers the Doctor her number two friend, then Silence, whom she met by chance, is her number one.\nIt is beyond us to learn just what level of contact she and Silence had in the past. That said, even here at Rhodes Island, she'll mock Silence's rectitude on one hand while unable to stop worrying about her on the other. Regardless of anything, it brings a smile to one's face, and as little as it is, it's silently improved quite a few of our Operators' impressions of her.",

The present Kafka may well look the same as back then, but inside, she's long since changed.\nShe'll bring young children nice little surprises on the sly, and she'll aid those who need it without batting an eye; in off time between missions, she'll commonly show up in Perfumer's garden, and the two get along very well these days.\nIt's clear as day, she's found a place for herself in Rhodes Island now.\nJust as we'd determined at the start, though life in the Columbian gray zone made her unwilling by nature to bare her soul to others, that nature itself was kind all along. It leads us to suppose, even, that she only took on such a nature to keep herself alive, disguising herself—cheating herself.",

Here I am, in the end, only now realizing I can't form a clear picture of what it is I even want to do. \nI'm certainly not qualified to be lecturing you on this occasion. \nOn another note.
