Operator Franka is a member of this unit tasked with guaranteeing the safety of all Bio Department operations. \nUnlike most Blacksteel specialists who are always serious to the point of being dour, Franka seems more light-hearted, progressive, and is even a bit of a prankster--her victims including both enemies and her own colleagues. \nNo matter the situation she faces, Franka is able to keep calm and persuade others to trust in her calculated words. \nFor a professional Operator, Franka submitted a relatively truthful personal profile and resume, as well as a standard cooperation agreement, voluntary treatment waiver, and other binding contracts. Based on that, Franka may be accorded the appropriate level of trust.",

She favors a rapier forged from Originium that, when combined with her own Originium Arts, absorbs a huge amount of heat (while still retaining its shape). It is especially effective against targets in heavy metal armor. It is very easy to overlook her light gear and weapons, leading to a gross underestimation of her combat prowess. \nOn the other hand, the close-up melee style she prefers also can put her in peril. While she may be good enough to end the enemy before her life is threatened, to alleviate concerns, the head of the BPRS project teamed the smart but radical Franka with the level-headed Liskarm, making them a complementary duo in combat.",

Her professionalism helped her integrate in no time, making her an essential part of combat missions. The mood on the island, in turn, has felt the impact of Franka's presence. \nFor example, during her tenure as the swordfighting instructor for reserve Operators, she 'initiated' every newbie in 'Columbian style training', i.e., hazing. At the same time, she held almost nothing back in passing on her knowledge and experience to the rookies. \nTo those on the island, their biggest impression of Franka, besides her professional combat instruction and unique combat style, is her regular clashing with her partner Liskarm.",

It's all because of that teacher’s pet. I listen to her nagging too much. Even when she's not here, I hear her voice in my head. \nStop thinking about these things. \n...... \nLet's keep those plans after all. \nRhodes Island is still moving forward, so I have to keep moving forward. \nMaybe one day... \nJust maybe, those places will open their doors to welcome the Infected.",
