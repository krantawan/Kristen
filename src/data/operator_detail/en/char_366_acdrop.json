This is reflected through her open-minded attitude towards all things in life— even when undergoing a series of examinations for her Oripathy, Miss Aciddrop would only lament that she had to postpone her cycling trip, as if her free-spirited travels were of greater importance than her condition. \nBy the way, Miss Aciddrop is not 'interested' in street culture. According to her own account, she was actually quite famous in her hometown prior to becoming infected: she had won many local skating competitions, children all wanted to learn how to skate from her, and she shared sibling-like bonds with some of the street artists there. —Though I first thought this was simply the boasting of a street girl, we discovered that a certain line of a famous, trendy sports brand really had plans to feature her as a model.

Though the mobility granted from being able to shoot while on a skateboard is of dubious value in actual combat, this Liberi's agility caught many operators off guard. 'It's like she's performing for a crowd,' one operator from the HR Department remarked. \nHowever, let this not overshadow the fact that Miss Aciddrop's proficiency with a hand crossbow is not inferior to her skill on the skateboard. It is said that she learned these skills from an old local policeman. As a student, Aciddrop was report to the police for 'excessive graffiti,' and was chased around three blocks by an old, seemingly-weak policeman. Afterwards, she was subjected to a scolding that was dozens of minutes long. After such incidents 'accidentally occurred several more times,' scolding soon turned into chatter, and the kindhearted old policeman seemed to take pity upon Aciddrop, for her parents were almost never home, leaving her to fend for herself. Intentionally or otherwise, the old policeman let his daughter become friends with Aciddrop, since the two of them were the same age. It is this daughter who first taught Aciddrop how to skate. \n'Of course, the pupil surpassed the teacher, eh?' Miss Aciddrop would happily proclaim.",

In order to give the young and energetic children a means to protect themselves, after hesitating again and again, the old policeman taught Aciddrop the basic techniques to operate a hand crossbow, and also made a simple weapon for her— after all, he believed that Aciddrop has a strong sense of justice and was not the kind of child who would do bad things with a weapon. \nUnfortunately, there were some issues with Aciddrop's loose definition of justice. During an unexpected auto accident, the brave Aciddrop unintentionally destroyed a gang's illegal Originium trading plan, triggering retaliation from the affected gang members. During a brawl that was disguised as a case of school bullying, gang members who were even younger than Aciddrop sprinkled Originium dust onto her.",

Glowed like the sun on the outer dunes back then. Now she caught Oripathy. Whereabouts... unknown. I wind this tape up, that marks one month she's been missing.\nStill remember how I taught her to use a crossbow. Spark in her eyes, same as my wife and kids. Touched your heart some more than a breeze in the woods, and my girl—girls—[CHUCKLE]—I thought to myself back then how I pretty much had two goddamn daughters. 'Aciddrop.' She was like part of our family. Like candy. Sometimes her father came, checked in on her. Gaulish man, built strong. Nothing but guilt and love in his eyes whenever he looked at his daughter. He and I drank. He said he didn't know how to be a good father. Could've said the same myself.\nUsed to figure with how our families knew each other, be one of the few fancy things in my old age, but that all changed. Overnight. Kid, uh... left two skateboards here with me. The ones I 'confiscated.' Dumped them in the junk room too. Rolled right under that army sword from Bolívar.\nI'm just an old guy. Saw these things happen before—never concerned me then. Wanted to do something... only today decided what. I know, look at me, death of a salesman. Best decision maker zero years running. Heh.\n[SILENCE]\nTaping two copies of this. Remember to send one to the kid if anyone finds her. I'll teach you how to fry onion rings for it. Secret's in the cheese.\n[SILENCE]\nThey've got the smarts to stick with their own. Not much chance I come out on top. Feel sorry for my girl. Her dad shouldn't be taking a risk like this. Makes me glad, though... I fessed up about all this and she was in tears. Gave me the go-ahead.\n[SILENCE]\nHey, kid. My daughter's all grown up now. How about you? Where you at?\nNo matter where you are, I bet you'll get along just fine.\nGangs. Hah. They gonna be scarier than the Steam Knights? Fire raining from the Witch King's spire?\n[SILENCE, POURING LIQUOR]\nRemember this, kid.\n'Cheers to freedom, cheers to onion rings, and cheers to me.'\n—Video cassette, previously held under strict safekeeping at a police station, sent to Rhodes Island after a case of station theft.
