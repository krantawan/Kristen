The feast he prepared on his first day here left such a deep impression on everyone that the very next day he received an invitation from the cafeteria to re-evaluate their menu together. He chose some surprising ingredients for the new menu, such as sandworm legs and cystybeast liver... but he did indeed optimize the cafeteria's offerings, and his cooking has become quite popular with the Operators.\nSenshi's insistence on a proper nutritious diet has been endorsed by many from the Medical Department, especially Operator Hibiscus. She once brought some of her healthy meals to Senshi for tasting, and he offered his immediate feedback: 'It's nutritious, aye, but I cannot appreciate any dish that neglects flavor. You need both.' Since then, Hibiscus's healthy meals have subtly changed, tasting much better than before, and more operators are now willing to try them out. Judging from the strange ingredients in her new recipe, Senshi likely played a significant role in it.",

After all, he has been adventuring for much longer than the others, to the point that some operators find it hard to believe.

After all, completing the mission as quickly as possible is often a higher priority than filling their stomachs. However, when on missions with Senshi, he can always find the time to forage for ingredients among the surrounding flora and fauna, enthusiastically explaining what is edible or not and the basics of cooking to his teammates, before setting up his shield-like pot to cook up a hot meal. To him, cooking and eating is a ritual not to be taken lightly. He has repeatedly insisted we take only what we need to preserve the delicate ecosystem, and this respect for nature is how 'adventurers' are able to keep themselves fed and healthy out in the wilds. The ecosystem encompasses every little thing that happens on this land, and only by preserving the cycle of give and take can everything continue smoothly. Perhaps it is because of this philosophy that missions with Senshi are often smooth-sailing.\nHis party members have mentioned how his cooking has kept them going in that faraway dungeon. And after some time, the operators he's taken under his wing have shared similar thoughts. Being with Senshi is like working with a capable elder. Though he can sometimes be a little stubborn, the food he makes and its warm aroma always sets people at ease.

It's all so strange, haha.'\n'That fascinating, is it? This cookware you wanted me to see.'\n'Just wait until you see it! I picked out the perfect one, if I say so myself. Here, it's a cooking pot. All you do is put the ingredients in, press the button, and it automatically cooks it for you.'\n'Come again? You press this button, nothing else, and the food makes itself?'\n'Yep, exactly.'\n'Don't even need a fire?'\n'Nope. If I remember right, it uses Originium technology for the cooking.'\n'Originium technology?'\n'Like, you pick a cooking method, and that signals the Originium circuits inside the pot to start working, so the air valve closes, and the element heats up, so steam builds inside the pot and raises pressure... I'm not sure what it all implies, though. I just heard that was how it worked.'\n'Originium circuits...'\n'With higher atmospheric pressures, the boiling point of water increases. This elevation in boiling point facilitates quicker cooking times. As a result, recipes that previously required extended stewing periods can now be completed in relatively shorter durations. That's what the manual says.'\n'Atmospheric... boiling points...'\n'For seasoning, there are all sorts of different packets with concentrated seasoning. Curry, chili, bolognese, the works. All you have to do is put the right amount in along with your ingredients. Press the button, wait until the alert sounds, and it's done.'\n'Concentrated seasoning...'\n'It's either extracted from the foods, or directly synthesized based on their compositions. With these helpers, even people who've hardly used a kitchen before can make some pretty delicious dishes.'\n'Synthesized... composition...'\n'Senshi, what's the matter?'\n'Laios, when did you start learning culinary magic?'\n'Wh... what?'\n'This sounds like nothing but magic to me! I've been telling you how those wizarding elves and gnomes end up too complacent and lazy from cooking with their magic! You know how dangerous that is in the dungeon!'\n'You say that, but why are you taking the pot anyway?'\n'I only wish to study it. Although I don't approve of cooking with magic, I can be sure of one thing: this type of cookware is essential to the Terran way of life. It's something I can learn more about Terra through.\n'In colder places, folks tend to store food in containers with better insulation. In hot places, people prefer those that cool off faster, are more breathable, and easier to wash.\n'You have to learn the lives of the locals to prepare the food that they enjoy.\n'Just like in the dungeon, aye?'",
