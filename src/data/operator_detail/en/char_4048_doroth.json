It was around this time that Operator Dorothy proposed to us a mutually beneficial collaborative project that would become the highest level collaboration between Rhine Lab and Rhodes Island to dateâ€”a project that is not only managed directly by a Rhine section director, but also necessitated said director's dispatchment to Rhodes Island.\nGiven her sensitive position, we must make this clear: despite her employment as a section director at Rhine Lab, Operator Dorothy never flaunts her position.\nThe reason we always bring up her position when we introduce her to others is that it is the best way to throw a spotlight on both her life and her most attention-worthy talent. She is one of the most outstanding leaders among Rhine Lab's many researchers, and one of the foremost experts in the field of Originium Arts applications. Some of us have seen for ourselves the results of the research projects she's been personally involved in.\nAlthough ultimately the former Energy Section Director Clooney was established as the mastermind behind the incident, there is no doubt that it is this lady with a bright smile on her face who produced the results of those dangerous experiments.",

            "storyText": "Operator Dorothy was born to a family of immigrants from Sargon. Her father was a civilian medic who practiced medicine in the wilderness, while her mother was a Pioneer.\nAs her father was often away, Dorothy was raised alone by her Pioneer mother. The sandy barrenlands became her most familiar sight during childhood, and her mother's fellow Pioneers became the people she was closest to besides her parents. She liked to write about each member of the Pioneer Team in her diary, and saw them all as irreplaceable family members.\nAs the descendant of Pioneers, Dorothy's mother also became a Pioneer who worked in the wastes, but evidently she did not want her daughter following in her footsteps. Dorothy had demonstrated extraordinary talent since childhood, with her grades in school far exceeding those of other children her age. Her parents were elated, and they worked hard to pay for her schooling and save for her college tuition so she would never have cause to worry financially. In today's Columbia, as long as someone has enough talent, they have the opportunity to leap up the social ladder, even the children of Pioneers. There is no way but up for the gifted. Of course, this also means that those without the qualifications already have their lives set in stone. However, at the very least, her parents truly believed that she had a much brighter future than theirs ahead of her.\nDorothy went on to meet their expectations as she grew up, her excellence obvious to all those around her. Her family celebrated when she received Ironforge Polytechnic's invitation to participate in its summer camp, not knowing that this would be the last time they would all be together. Dorothy's mother was killed along with many of her Pioneer Team members when a Catastrophe struck the temporary base they were in.\nDorothy's father tried very hard to console his distressed daughter, but was largely unable to do so. However, when she finally emerged from her room after locking herself inside for a few days, her sorrow seemed to have largely died down.\nSurely, she'd already found her direction by then.",

There, she sometimes runs into other operators who share the same interest. It wasn't long before she received an invitation to join the movie lovers' club and became part of that small community.\nDorothy is kind and compassionate by nature, and very much enjoys taking care of those around her. Many of our operators have been on the receiving end of her gentle nagging. Unfortunately, though, it seems she rarely counts herself as someone to be taken care of. So even while she is looking out for others, she is often in pretty bad shape herself.\nThose who've worked with her before at Rhine Lab have long since gotten used to how worrying she can be. Operator Astgenne often proactively takes on the responsibility of caring for her, which Dorothy always seems a little embarrassed about. But sometimes, she drops her big sister-like facade and opens her eyes wide like a little girl, making all kinds of tiny, inconsequential requests of Astgenne.\nThat said, based on Operator Silence's observations and reports, it is also worth pointing out that Dorothy can be somewhat biased in her viewpoints, especially when it comes to ideas like 'protecting everyone' and 'making everyone happy.' When these topics are brought up in conversation, she can sometimes suffer minor emotional breakdowns. This deep-rooted obsession grew out of her family's situation and is not so easy to defuse.",

            "storyText": "According to Operator Dorothy herself, in contrast to company veterans such as Saria and Ferdinand, she is the Rhine Lab section director to have most recently joined the company. Originally, Rhine Lab consisted only of nine sections. It was not until she jumped ship from a government research institute, along with her projects, that the tech company heavily supported by the Columbian government formed its Originium Art Section, thus creating its ten-section structure.\nAt Rhine Lab, Dorothy's relationship with the other section directors is not bad in general. At the very least, they are able to stay amicable enough on the surface. Even Ferdinand, generally known to be difficult to get along with, has given her plenty of assistance with her research. Although she was aware that his help came at a high price, no price was too high when she was about to achieve her dream.\n\n[Voice Log]\n'Yes, I was the last one to join. Kristen, Saria, Ferdinand, and Parvis were the original members.'\n'Oh, I guess that might cause confusion. It was Kristen and Saria who started the company. Ferdinand and Parvis were the first ones to join them.'\n'Just like me, they brought their projects with them. Rhine Lab has always been taking in members like us. All of us have stable, workable projects. Kristen gave us a platform, and we gave back to the company with our results.'\n'It was Kristen who approached me back then. She understood my research, and was willing to give me the support I needed. When they hired me, the project that Parvis handed to Olivia had just gone wrong... Oh, it's not as bad as it sounds. An experiment had failed, that's all.'\n'The company was in a huge mess because of Director Saria. That was the first time I saw Kristen like that. Perhaps that was when Ferdinand started coming up with his plans.'\n'As for what happened this time... Ferdinand's got his own ideas, and I'm not in a position to judge his actions when I was also involved.'\n'Parvis? Hm...'\n'Most of the time, he's very easy to talk to. He doesn't offend anyone. You could have tea with him, listen to music, and it's all fine.'\n'But Parvis is a researcher, too. So is Ferdinand, so is Kristen. And so am I.'\n'Well, I really didn't want to put it this way, but...'\n'Doctor, I'm sure you know what I mean. We're so alike, after all.'",

Nonetheless, behind that sincerity lies an element of danger, which we must not underestimate simply because this researcher possesses a warm smile, an attentive gaze, and genuine concern for others. Even though the crisis caused by the experiment has died down and Operator Dorothy has not displayed any dangerous tendencies, we must be aware of the fact that she never has and never will stray from her purpose.\nâ€”She truly wishes for everyone to equally find happiness.\nEven during her college years, she was already paying close attention to some of Loken Williams's research. From this, we can surmise that whenever Loken gave lectures at the university, Dorothy was likely sitting there in the audience, and was thus influenced by some of his ideals. In particular, her similar attitude towards experimental ethics can be seen in the recent incident. We can only guess what kind of role Rhine Lab had in the 'Loken Watertank' incident, and moreover what kind of part Dorothy herself played. However, none of our guesses are particularly optimistic.\nIt's also worth noting that it was Operator Saria who first expressed her opinion on Dorothy's onboarding even though she had interacted with her the least during their time at Rhine Lab.\n'I know people like her.'\nSaria reminded us, 'Be careful. They're the kind of people who will do whatever it takes to achieve what they consider beautiful.'",

Subconsciously, the girl thinks to call for her mother, but remembers none of the Pioneer grown-ups are in the base right now, out on their exploration missions.\nA massive boom. The roof of the temporary living quarters is battered.\nMalevolent yellow monsters close in. The girl cannot run, only shrink back into the corner of her bed. From deep underground, up floats a silver light that lands upon her cheek, very much like her mother's hand would.\nThe girl hugs her mother's storybook tight. She recalls her telling tale after tale. From those gentle passages, she strives to draw some courage.\nThe storm curls through layer upon layer of sand. Brighter grows the silver light, which transforms into a gleaming ribbon and gently lifts the girl up.\nInto a silver dreamland she falls. In this cool yet warming reverie, she flies on moonlight, the storm and monsters never to catch up.\n'...how is she now?'\n'Vital signs normal. She's been spooked a little, but she'll be awake real soon.'\n'Do you think those waves of abnormal energy just now...'\n'Earliest Pioneer records say this silver stuff's a special material that goes by the name of 'Transmitter,' developed by a scientist who joined a Pioneer Team voluntarily. Pioneers liked to call it 'Silver Slippers,' because it always helped anyone in trouble get home.'\n'Wasn't that... back when this frontier first got broken in, all those years ago? I honestly thought it was just a legend.'\n'Nope. It's real.' Atop the sickbed, the girl opens her eyes. 'Mom...'\n'Mommy's right here.'\n'Mom, where'd she go? The one who owned the 'Silver Slippers'...'\nHer mother is silent for a moment, before resolving to tell the girl the truth.\n'If the records are true, then she did live here. But nobody knows where she went after that. Maybe she went missing on some deep delve, or maybe... she went of her own will, onto the next frontier, and the one after that, ever further out.'\nThrough the girl's eyes flashes a brief sense of disappointment. But very shortly, she catches sight of the storybook by her bedside, and springs up, grabbing it and hugging it close to her chest.\n'I get it, Mom. She's the same as the hero in the storybook you gave me, right?'\n'The... the girl who's always journeying on?'\n'Yeah, she's my favorite!'\n'Apparently, its author was an early Pioneer too. Who was based on what, we can't be sure...'\n'It's real.' The girl's eyes twinkle with light. 'She'll see her family again, and she can make dreams real, because I know it. She's just like me.'",
