Among them, some robbed the rich to give to the poor. Ever since, the residents of the Iberian coastline often sang the praises of such heroic outlaws. After the Profound Silence, however, the seas became infested with Seaborn, and pirates vanished from Iberia. That said, although the age of piracy is long behind us, their stories are still told to this day by their descendants. Thanks to this, even as a small child, Tulip greatly admired the seas her ancestors once sailed. By contrast, the lectures of the bishops became comparatively less interesting. Nevertheless, Tulip learned much during middle school, including how to read and write, and also came to realize the tragic reality of the Inquisition's rule.\nEver since, Tulip has considered the Inquisition an evil that tramples upon the freedoms of others. As a way of putting her personal sense of justice in practice, she led a small group of bandits and wandered Iberia to rob the rich. However, due to the great disparity in their strength, she and her friends were ultimately captured by the Inquisition.\nWhile they were being escorted to the Bastión de Cánticos, they were attacked by a group of Sea Terrors, leading to Tulip and her gang being temporarily pardoned to help fight against the monsters. Although their chances of survival were slim, she gave it her all against their common foe until Catastrophe fell.\nThe Catastrophe killed every living being in the vicinity other than her, and left her Infected. Since then, she has been ostracized by everyone she met. That was the first time she realized just how lonely and helpless Iberia's Infected can be. She then took on the name Tulip and devoted what meager strength she had to helping Iberia's Infected.\nDuring her investigation into Ægir, Kal'tsit learned of Tulip's feats and formed a long-term agreement to exchange Tulip's intel for the supplies she needed. After the founding of Rhodes Island, Kal'tsit then extended her an invitation to become its officer-in-charge for Iberian affairs. She accepted after confirming that Rhodes Island truly is a company that aims to help the Infected.",
