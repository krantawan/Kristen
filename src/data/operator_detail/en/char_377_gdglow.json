She was raised in poverty among many siblings, being the Glitters' sixth child. Possessing high Originium Arts assimilation, she was once referred to a local Caster institute for further studies, but was unable to complete them due to household economic factors. After her father's passing, she fell into Messenger work, but was accidentally infected on the job and became a sufferer of Oripathy. So as not to add to her family's economic burden, she traveled south from place to place, towards the city of Caladon. There she found employment and took up residence, coming into incidental contact with multiple Rhodes Island operators.\nAfter foiling a Caladon city councilor's plot, she was jointly recommended by Operators Quercus, Grani and Bitter Root. Upon passing the tests, she was taken in as a Rhodes Island Logistics Operator. Her main vocation is as a hairdresser, responsible for providing the Rhodes Island landship's operators and visitors with hairstyling services. At the same time, and at her own suggestion, a reserve Caster Operator course has been prepared for her to further explore, control, and stabilize her Originium Arts potential.",

After both infection with Oripathy and violent stimulation by a string of incidents in Caladon City, her Originium Arts began to fall out of control, expressed through continual and involuntary electrical discharge. In response to the nature of her Arts dysfunction, the workshop upgraded her staff to negate the negative effects of a static charge. Paired with a number of minor everyday measures, its basic impact on life was minimized. However, she won't be holding her staff 24/7, and the little tips are bound to fail at times—not to mention her intermittent desire to use static for small pranks on her friends. As such...\nAddressing the root issue calls for starting from the beginning: systematically learning the relevant theory on Arts usage. Currently, Goldenglow attends a classroom with a group of reserve Casters and children aboard the Island, reviewing, learning, and revising. For her, it's both strange and refreshing, and she's willing to commit to it. On top of which, she wholeheartedly looks forward to her achievements to come.\nHer life is full of hope.",

In the past, life was full of hardships, but at present, she found herself able to contribute to the family finances. Her mother's reply came very quickly after she mailed her first payment. Aside from the standard greetings and expounding on the household's latest developments, there was (between the lines) a repeatedly emphasized concern. She was scared that her daughter, out on her own and Infected to boot, might be up to something dangerous. Especially given that she'd suddenly acquired a respectable sum of money. To lift her mother's worries, and considering Rhodes Island just so happened to be near Victoria's northern border when she sent her second remittance, she wrote a letter asking to either drop in back home, or, if her mother was just too worried, she could bring her brothers and sisters along to Rhodes Island, and the money this time would be their travel expenses, paid by Goldenglow herself. Thus, some weeks later, Rhodes Island had a group of Feline visitors aboard.\nGoldenglow met her family once again. And standing right at the front: an exhausted, fretful, and resolutely determined Feline woman.\nHer dear mother.",

After Goldenglow inadvertently gave her mother a shock, yet was then embraced tightly, she lost the last of her self-control and fell to pieces, crying on the spot, not at all noticing that with the whole family all clumped together, they'd completely blocked a entire corridor of Rhodes Island.\nOn returning to the dormitories, she gave her mother a simple rundown of her situation at Rhodes Island, who remained skeptical of the organization. However, thanks to how they'd been treated so far and hearing it from her girl's own mouth, a weight finally fell from Mrs. Glitter's mind, and she immediately instructed her other children to bring out the local specialties they'd brought. Since Mrs. Glitter had eight children with her (not counting Goldenglow herself!), and each one had brought plenty of gifts for the journey, Goldenglow's dormitory was practically filled with a mountain of boxes. At her earnest pleading, HR made an exception and accepted some of the gifts themselves, until they too were drowned in boxes, and all the dormitories' operators became new targets.\nAs evening fell, the riot the family created finally wound down. Rhodes Island provided temporary dormitories for its visitors, and Goldenglow finally had time for a heart-to-heart with her mother.\nAfter her daughter's departure, Mrs. Glitter had found a higher-paying job, and as all her children gradually came of age, they'd properly begun to work and supplement the family income too. Though still far from well-off, the family finally had some money set aside, and could support their daughter's treatment costs. Before leaving, Mrs. Glitter contemplated bringing Goldenglow back home—after all, the two had a deep mother-daughter bond, and she wasn't going to see her daughter suffering out there. However, after taking in Rhodes Island's practical circumstances and hearing her daughter recount her experiences over the past few years, Mrs. Glitter decided to respect her daughter's wishes, and let her expand her horizons freely aboard Rhodes Island.\nMrs. Glitter is fully aware that Rhodes Island can provide what Victoria cannot, and that her daughter is unwilling to abandon this opportunity.\nAnd so, after obtaining her family's approval, Goldenglow officially decided on her own goals. She would work and study aboard Rhodes Island, and with that as the crux, imagine her future prospects with vast, wild abandon.\nThough this land remains grey, at least what Susie Glitter sees in this moment is a clear, sparkling future.",

Or will she treat studying the use of Arts as a form of hobby?'\n'Or suppose, perhaps, that's as deep as she'll delve, and she'll turn her efforts to hairdressing, or maybe bartending, for the rest of her days?'\n'That's not something for Rhodes Island to decide for her.'\n'Even if she's unusually talented.'\n—Extract from recording of Quercus's evaluation of Goldenglow",

Her workbook lays open to the side, strewn with soundly proofed notes of all the bits she had no idea of (or the wrong idea).\n<i>It's time you slept...</i> Her falling eyelids give her a nudge.\nAnd so, just before going to bed, she stuffs everything she needs for the exam tomorrow in her bag, peeks over her shoulder, and flips her daily scheduler open. What she'll be up to each day, sorted neat and tidily in here—a habit she picked up from working at Quercus's. Procurement, punctual opening and closing, running inventory, cleaning the shop... With so much to do—none of it trivial—on top of frequent and ever-urgent surprises, having everything she needed written out gave her no small relief.\nHer schedule for tomorrow runs as follows:\nMorning\n(7:30-9:30) Exam time!\n(9:30-10:30) TA for Intro to Originium Arts Theory\nNoon\n(12:00-13:00) Help out at hairdressers\nAfternoon\n(14:00-16:00) Practice a bit at training grounds/tidy up plant nursery for Lena (ask first, might not be today)\n(17:00-18:00) Help out at hairdressers\n(18:00-21:00) Help out at bar\n(21:00-22:00) Reading break\nSusie stares and thinks. After a moment, she shortens her shift at the bar and adds a new item below it:\n(20:00-?) Have a talk with Theory tutor about future\nWith how responsible Rhodes Island's tutors and operators all are, she's not one bit worried she'll fail the exam. But as for what's in store for her from now on? That's definitely a conversation her tutor can help with.\nThese days, she's gotten the static that once exploded out of her a little under control, and—though hardly anyone notices—she's already started using little tricks from her casting course in her hairdressing. A tactical dab of electrical charge here and there for even swifter, cleaner haircuts.\nAnd all, so that one day—\nSusie leafs forward through the scheduler a little, and stops. Out in the midst of all these untouched pages, there's one event, a single note that's been written long, long in advance:\nSend money to Mum\nMum keeps telling her she doesn't need to do anything of the sort, but she can't help wanting to send something back home. And this is about when Mum'd always send her money too—somehow, it's become their unofficial way of letting each other know they're still well.\nSusie flips the scheduler back to tomorrow, and gives the freshly filled-in cells a few strokes of her fingers.\nShe's a grounded person. She knows that whatever far-flung future she's imagining, it's not her life in the here and now. She likes to give each book a proper read, do each job well, catch each opportunity when it comes. Imagination's a volatile thing, after all... Still, her current everyday, her life aboard Rhodes Island, is one that so clearly rewards her for her efforts, and isn't that precisely what she's wanted all along?\nSo she corrects that item a little:\n(20:00-?) Have a talk with Theory tutor about upcoming course\n<i>That's</i> what she should be asking.\nTime to turn in now... Her heavy eyes tug at her lids, desperate to pull down the shutters.\nSo she heeds, puts away the scheduler, turns off the lights, and tries to calm her nervously fluttering heart. She'll get good marks tomorrow. It's in her power.\nTomorrow's still a busy day, and tomorrow will reward her for it.\n......\nSusie falls into deep, warm, contented slumber."
