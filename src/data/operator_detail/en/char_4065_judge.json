She also maintains a sibling-like relationship with Vigil, leading us to believe that the Bellone family may not be your average Siracusan mafia family. We know little about the former don of the Bellones, however, so more information in this regard must await further discussion with Penance and Vigil.\nThere were doubts as to whether Penance would be able to adapt to Rhodes Island's legal department, given her clear stance on the inviolability of law and justice, as well as the fact that Rhodes Island often operates in legal grey areas. However, she has shown a proper understanding of our true mission; rather than coming into conflict with operators who have different methods from her, they seem to have an implicit understanding, even quietly helping each other out. Perhaps those who are well-versed in the legal world understand that, deep down, they share the common goal of defending justice, no matter what circumstances may have forced them to do, and no matter what means they use now.",

There are no police, only judges who are responsible for public order, speaking the will of Signora Sicilia.\nThe vast majority of incidents are taken care of under the table by the families involved, most of them never making it to court. The judges themselves are often informed after the fact that a case has been resolved, or, in some cases, needs them to resolve it quietly. Even when a case does make it to court, the outcome of the trial is often influenced or outright decided by the family.\nThose who knew Penance during her time as Judge Lavinia called her a 'righteous' judge. In Siracusa, judges labeled as such often end up disappearing or losing part of a limb, as a warning to the other judges.\nPenance never ended up that way, though she never thought of herself as particularly righteous.\nShe told us that she became a judge with the help of the Bellone family. When she was first appointed, the former don of the family had promised her a better future, where she would truly deliver the justice of the law. The nature of the Bellone family seemed to have given her more freedom, but also more pain, as she saw such justice delivered by the family as inherently unjust.\nStill, Penance has never allowed her troubles to affect those around her, nor demanded the same of others as she does of herself, as in the case of Vigil, for example. This is mostly because they came from the same place, of course, and Vigil does not exactly lead a healthy lifestyle. As such, most of the other operators show an understanding.",

He abandoned his ideals before he died, but he held on to his appointment letter. Meanwhile, I'm still here today, breathing and in one piece, because everyone knows that the Bellones are behind Judge Lavinia.\n'How did the rule of law come to this in Siracusa? I sit with the mafiosi every day, listening to them telling me what to do, and I do everything in my power to do it well, because it's 'better' for everyone. Everyone goes about their business as usual the next day, because I did.\n'But I can see the fear in the eyes of the common folk, the way they keep their distance. After the sentence is pronounced, they dare not cry where there are prying eyes, or make their appeals to a judge.\n'What am I doing? Defending the law? Justice? Society? Public order? None of the above. All the judges, all the courts; the entire legal system of Siracusa is designed to be an accomplice for the mafia.\n'The people who had high ideals are dead. But I'm alive, and you're alive.

The mafia fight for control, while the common folk do not have the luxury of caring about where they live. As a judge, she has earned an approval of sorts from Signora Sicilia. It is still justice backed by political power, but for the first time in her life, she finds herself with sufficient freedom, and finds herself facing a question that she never had time to think about:\nWhat should she do as a judge, when all of Siracusa is used to the courts serving the mafia?\nGrowing up in Siracusa, she never had the chance to see how things are done in other places. No matter how much she disapproves of the system, no matter how much she wants to free Siracusa from mafia control—what is the Siracusan legal system without the famiglie?\nIt is always easier to destroy than to build from scratch. Things have not been easy, even with like-minded comrades like Vigil around. Nor have they truly freed Siracusa from mafia control. How, then, are they to build a new order?\nAs a mere judge, Penance knows that her powers are limited, and she knows that building a new order is no easy task. What she learned and experienced over the past several years is far from enough to guide her towards a new legal system that people can accept. Now, she finds herself understanding Bernardo's actions: his mad dream had been a Siracusa without the mafia, while her own mad dream is a city where true justice is upheld. Bernardo gave his life for his dream. How far will she go?\nUnder the influence of alcohol, Penance spoke of the late Bellone don in the presence of the Doctor. She spoke of how she seemed to understand him so well, yet not at all; how he gave her hope, yet never trusted her even unto the end. All she can do is bear witness to the hope he left behind, and devote the rest of her life to realizing it, but there will never come a day when they watch the dream come true together.\n'I hate him so much, but the more I hate him, the more I...' Those were Penance's final words before she passed out and was carried back to her quarters by the Doctor.",

Some around her had even gone missing by now.\nBut she stayed her course. After all, she'd long prepared herself mentally. These troubles could not trounce her; in fact, the more they cropped up, the more she believed she had to change this status quo.\n—All until she finished her work for the day, and entered the alley where she had parked her vehicle.\nIt was then that she thought she should drop in tomorrow to see the man who'd supported her taking this path, to tell him how she hadn't let him down. And on the other hand she thought, perhaps, that that would make her seem too much a pushover; maybe something sterner was called for. After all, should his own Famiglia fall afoul of a lawsuit themselves, she could only be impartial.\nIf not for that familiar hand pulling her down, her head may well have been skewered by the bolt.\nShe felt her own thoughts halt, leaving her staring blankly at the hand's owner—Bernardo stood in her way, taking out each figure that rushed her one by one.\nAnd only once she snapped out of it did she finally realize the gulf between what she'd heard and pictured, and experiencing it personally.\nA momentary silence descended on the alley, at which point Bernardo gave the underlings to his rear a nod, and they brought out a box half her size.\nBernardo opened it, and within, there laid a metal gauntlet with a hammer shackled to it. Under the dusk streetlamps, their gold luster almost stung the eye, but what hurt most about them to see was the circle of thorns winding about the glove.\n'I'm not going to protect you forever, Lavinia,' said Bernardo, as he took out the gauntlet and handed it to her. 'If you want to survive on this path, then you've got to learn to protect yourself, starting today.'\nShe was silent for a spell, took the gauntlet, and with no regard for the pain its sharp thorns laced across her skin, she put it on. Then, she walked deeper into the alley depths.\nShe and Bernardo had brushed with death. She knew though the night was deep as ever, Bernardo would not take the same path as her. She had to go it alone into the darkness, a black dyed in sanguine red.\nThe first and only gift Bernardo would ever give her was stained by blood on its very first day.",

The pale, faded light of dawn is the guest that has yet to arrive, for whom there is nothing to do but wait.\nSuch nights are a familiar friend to Lavinia. What awaits after an exhausting day is yet another exhausting day, filled with pretentious defending counsels, arrogant famiglia and silent judges. The sound of the gavel echoes through the court, yet it is no different from a fairground game, except worse, because at least in a fairground the hammer whacks the mole.\nWhen tormented by such cruel nights, Lavinia pulls out the creased letter from the bottom of her drawer. She remembers finding it under her windscreen wipers; such letters were usually threats and warnings, but this was an exception.\nIt is a short letter, scribbled down hastily, reproaching Lavinia for pronouncing innocent a defendant that the famiglia had sent into the courthouse to take the fall. The letter wrote that Lavinia's 'self-righteous' judgment had done more harm than good, a complaint that she had seen many times: The small attempts of the judges to do the right thing are often futile, any small justice achieved in the courthouse quickly swallowed by the dark night outside.\nYet the writer, after what seemed to be a long struggle with himself, left this line at the end: 'No one cares, but at least there was one person who said I was innocent. Thanks.'\nLavinia has tried to deduce whom the writer of this unusual letter was, which is akin to trying to find a needle in a haystack. There have been so many, people whom she knew were innocent, whom she pronounced innocent, but what of it? As the writer of the letter said: No one cares.\nLavinia never stopped searching. Perhaps she wanted to tell the writer face-to-face, that justice would never be alone and fleeting, as long as she was there, that justice would come at the gavel's drop, as the dawn breaks the night.\nThat is, until she found the coroner's autopsy report on her desk. The cause of death was suicide.\nIf this was the end that Siracusa had for its judges, then what was the point of the justice that she sought?\nA creased letter, a word of thanks. However insignificant it was, even if it could not light her desk like a lamp, perhaps there was someone who felt that she was the only defender of justice, then and there.\nAnd so, she never gave up, even if she fights a lonely battle. If she gives up, there will be no one left to fight it; if she kept silent, there will be no one to speak up.\nThere are two ways to live with the night before the dawn. Allow it to consume oneself, until one does not feel it, or search for what should not be consumed by it, and keep those things safe.\nThe one thing that must not be surrendered is the right to define the light.",
