But the more Ægir I check, the less I understand...\nLike, say, since water on land contains trace amounts of Originium, that Originium should enter the ocean as part of the water cycle... so why is there hardly any in the sea? And when we look at water and finbeast samples from the deep sea, provided by our Ægir friends, they have zero Originium content. Zero. So why do the Ægir themselves have tiny amounts of Originium in their bodies?\nUnderflow definitely noticed me dancing around the subject during her medical exam. She told me 'your questions could stand to be more direct,' then answered everything I asked her one by one. From the ocean to the land, from the Seaborn to humanity... Either I missed out on some important textbooks during my schooling, or the facts she could rattle off are already way beyond what we know.\nTruth be told, when she was speaking halfway through, my curiosity turned to fear. When Rhodes was in touch with the Hunters in the past, they'd always be rather vague when it came to the ocean. So why are the Ægir dumping all this knowledge on us now, out of the blue?\n—A certain Medical Operator",

Ever since meeting this Ægir, and despite her prompt responses to every topic he ventures, the urging looks she gives him seemed quite irritable. She did come all this way from the bottom of the sea, so there was no need to question her sincerity... It must be the questions he's been asking. Maybe advanced civilizations have even stricter etiquette. Maybe the topics he picked are boring her out of her mind. Maybe what he considered a proud bearing seemed riddled with holes to her... No, he is determined to give Victorian etiquette one more chance. He'll use the topic he's most familiar with to feel out the envoy once more.\nAnd so, with the most precise, graceful turn of the neck in his impeccably-starched collar, he looks out the window at the dark clouds above the city, the slightest tinge of sullenness in his gaze, before leisurely mentioning the weather. The moment he speaks, the Ægir deftly answers, as she had before. Oceanic currents, precipitation on land, every form of climatological factor, the emotional undertones of every type of weather... Even when discussing something so banal, she was confident and eloquent enough to make even the most blue-blooded lord feel inferior. Once finished, she glances at him once more with that stomach-churning, urging look.\nRight now, a noble officer is beginning to feel despair.\nHe finally realizes that his guest from an advanced society truly does have higher standards of etiquette. Sure, she has allowed him to save face by engaging with his questions in all seriousness, but he can see how his crudeness and jitters must disgust her. He does not remember how he escaped the dining hall later that day.\n\n[Audio Log: Underflow and Irene]\n'Wait. Let me write down the conversation from that day for you to look at.'\n'I'm surprised you can remember every word you said.'\n'Just a skill any praefecta should have. Done. Could I trouble you to check if anything went against the land's ethics or common sense?'\n'Uhh... I don't see anything strange.'\n'Thank you, Irene, for confirming that the knowledge I had on hand was accurate. But then... why did the officer flee in such a panic? I took everything he brought up dead seriously. Though I admit I didn't quite understand why he turned to topics like that.'\n'My maestro once told me that before the Profound Silence, Iberians loved to get together to eat, dance, and chat about pointless things. Maybe the custom lives on in other nations?'\n'You mean chatting was itself the purpose of the gathering? If that's the case, perhaps I was at fault for the meeting's failure. I'm not the best at small talk, and I was trying to hint that we could get down to business. But why would a Victorian envoy offer to chat with me in the first place?'\n'Maybe he just wanted to smooth over any cultural differences beforehand, make things easier for future meetings. I guess he didn't consider that talking isn't always the best way of breaking down barriers. For me, it wasn't until I saw the Hunters dancing that I began to understand your culture.'\n'Is that why you're inviting me to that dance party?'\n'Not entirely, but... also not wrong.'\n'I see. Then I accept your invitation.'",

Compared to the liquid metal shooter or ion blaster standard arms she describes... this 'own work' of hers is still something I can comprehend. Though I'm still unsure how it operates underwater, or how it can rapidly change ammo types, I can see that it mainly uses the toxins in its ammunition.\nShe told me the effects and use-cases for nearly every type of poison. I tried my best to keep up, but when she talks about something she's familiar with, it's like she's a whole other person. Hard to imagine someone usually so reticent being able to talk so much and so quickly. I almost suspect her brain cells transmit information faster than us. In short, there are many types of poison, effective on many different creatures... Oh, there's one detail that I did remember. She mentioned a type of concentrated toxin that can 'shut down neuronavigation processes in people', but specifically avoided talking about a use-case. It's pretty obvious when she's trying to hide something. I don't remember anything other than that one useless detail.\nAs for putting the dismantled weapon back together? She said as long as I managed to get the right main points out of her explanation, I'd be able to reassemble it, easy as pie... I think she's expecting too much out of the average person.\nShe's a nice lady, but a terrible teacher, turns out.",

Since we've formally established a cooperative relationship with the government of Ægir, the person they sent over will definitely be suitable for our tests.'\n'Setting aside whether Dr. Kal'tist would see through that bluff, we have to at least consider the image of the department, right? We can't let people think we're all mad scientists obsessed with experiments here.'\n'It's called a thirst for knowledge! Surely the Ægir can get behind that!'\n'But Underflow's not an Abyssal Hunter. What's there to research with her?'\n'The experiment this time is real simple. You've seen her use her sketchpad before, yeah? Of course you have, she uses it every day. What I'm wondering is if she'll retain normal cognitive function if we take it away.'\n'Eh?'\n'Yes, I suspect she has an issue with her brain. The sketchpad is used to help keep her thoughts in line. Only through drawing can she think properly.'\n'...Eh?'\n'Just try it! There's only so much medicine can do for brain damage, so if there's a way to work around it with an assistive device...'\n\n[Addendum]\nDon't listen to Dr. Warfarin. There are no issues with Underflow's brain. Her shorthand is not a cognitive assistance method, but rather a way to surpass the speed of thought. Her pen is like a needle guiding the central thread of her mind through complex pathways. I am unsure as to what requires such a fast thinking, though.\nI dare say she really does think more than the vast majority of people, and much faster, though I cannot say for sure <i>what</i> she thinks of. Normally, she only says what is absolutely necessary, and it's rare to hear her talk about what she thinks or feels. As for the drawings and lines on her sketchpad, they are even more incomprehensible.\nHowever, she is not completely incapable of expressing her thoughts. Have you seen her trying things out in the kitchen for ten hours straight? That's how she spends her free time. She makes unusual dishes, and insists on sampling them in sequence. She carefully mulls over the sensations of tasting, chewing, and swallowing them, allowing all the flavors soak into her tongue... It's times like these when you can see a variety of emotions from her. At first, you may think it's some form of 'bizarre cooking,' but eat it enough and you'll find that carefully sipping on powder smelling of benthic plants really does have relaxing properties, while chewing tough, sour, and spicy dried meat tinged with a light bitterness can bring tears to your eyes... And then there's the poems and drawings she places next to the meal. More immersive than watching a play. I believe this is her unique way of expressing herself.\nIt's a pity she seems unaware she has fans like me. She never tells anyone when she's done cooking. She just places it wherever in the cafeteria's storage cabinets. Most of the time, her masterpieces have been snatched away by Kay, even if we rush over.\nNot much we can do about it. Just another habit of hers she brought from Ægir. Apparently, they only need to upload whatever new creation they think up, and anyone in the nation can print it out from some sort of terminal. How very sophisticated.",

If there is a data error, it will be very difficult to determine the cause. I have already blended a new formula suited for the new conditions. It's there in front of you. In addition, I gave this hibernation pod the ability to change the gel's composition at any time.

In fact, we shouldn't.'\n'Her desire itself is in error.'\n'You're right. There shouldn't be any Ægir willing to undergo a transformation of the body, to become a Hunter... But we've come this far. Does refusing an applicant really make sense?'\n'You misunderstand me. There is no fault in wishing to become an Abyssal Hunter, but that is not her only wish. She wants to become me. A frightening thought.'\n'She's been in dispute with you more often as of late. You know what this means. She's becoming more dependent on you.'\n'And so I must stop her. Ægir should not harbor such a desire. The Institute of Development Planning has files on near a millennium worth of personnel. None have ever expressed the desire to become someone else. It would mean abandoning the self, and if people were to abandon the uncovering of their own unique potential, to emulate their idol set in stone... the nation would be soon to fall.'\n'Very well. What is she to do then, continue her research? I can take her into my lab.'\n'Let her decide for herself. She must deny her desire, and find her own way forward. She must understand that to devote oneself to civilization does not mean sacrificing the self. These are dark times, and the situation is dire.

      "desc": "Neural stimulants, whether taken orally, injected or inhaled, can temporarily increase one's perceptive and cognitive powers, but become a health risk with long-term usage.\nCoffee serves a similar function to neural stimulants for landwalkers. The creation of coffee involves a complex process whereby the fruit of the coffee plant is processed multiple times using specific techniques, equipment, and procedures.\nThere are many detailed subcategories of coffee products by taste and quality, and the process of its usage is equally complex. Landwalkers consume coffee orally at specified times and occasions, with specific rules for how it is consumed.\nDespite being more harmful than typical neural stimulants, coffee appears to be far less effective. No obvious stimulation effects were observed after consuming ten standard portions of Siracusan espresso. How could such complex manufacturing and usage procedures lead to such a mild effect?\n...\nSystematic research has revealed that the manufacturing and usage of coffee is a terrestrial ritual. The meaning behind the complex manufacturing process is manifested in the form of taste of quality, and perceived by the user when consumed orally. Emphasis on a specific time and place asserts the solemnity of the ritual, while rules about consumption increases the sense of participation. The user is subject to a form of psychic suggestion to stay awake, which compensates for any deficiencies in actual potency.\nWhile the rituals involved are complex and difficult to comprehend, there may be lessons to be learned from the employment of psychic suggestion as a form of mental stimulation. Although the Institute of Development Planning will intervene in the event that an Ægir citizen overuses neural stimulations by rescheduling work or adjusting requirements, individual citizens, out of an obsession for their creative activities or personal values, may occasionally ignore the IDP's intervention and continue to administer neural stimulants in large quantities. While adjustive measures exist to deal with the circumstances of such citizens, there is a need for a less harmful form of neural stimulation to assist them during a creative fever. Progress has been made to reduce the side effects of neural stimulants through technological means, but perhaps we could also investigate the possibility of integrating terrestrial psychic suggestion into the use of neural stimulants, in order to achieve the same effect with a lower dosage...\nWe should leave some of the experiment results for him. He could use it... assuming we don't have to execute him when he comes back."
