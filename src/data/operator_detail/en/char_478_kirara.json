Prior to Kirara's own unfortunate contraction of Oripathy, she had been living a proper, stable life as a student should have, her only worry about the tumult of war being whether games produced by the north could make it safely across the chaos zone, for a smooth delivery by their hired shinobi.",

For the introverted girl, Rhodes Island offering her treatment for Oripathy also gave her somewhere to stay for a while, and for the money she paid as compensation, it was quite a worthwhile deal. At first, that's all it was.\nHowever, plans are where the little things always go awry. While the Higashi girl would shut herself in her room the majority of the time, using SMS in place of verbal dialogue, and making maximum efforts possible to avoid interacting directly with others, on her occasional 'outings,' she'd always come back having helped some operators while she was out, at times resolving some minor issues with electronic equipment, or being entrusted ad-hoc with instructing operators on how to work appliances, and once she'd even been pursued with inquiries for a walkthrough of a popular game at the time... In short, before Kirara herself even realized it, she was already on fairly good terms with our operators.\nWe very quickly sent a formal invitation to this Higashi girl, inviting her to become one.\nGratefully, fearful of strangers as she was, she didn't decline.",

In contrast to our understanding of Iberia's internal situation, Higashi's Ægir by and large have not been faced with overt exclusion, putting down roots in the country without a problem. In the present day, Kirara's own recognition of herself tells the tale—without any weight to it, she can say 'I'm just a normal Higashi girl, that's all.'\nHowever, as is plain to see, stemming from different environs in upbringing, Kirara and other Higashi operators—for example, Operator Matoimaru—have differing conceptions of many things, despite being fellow Higashi.\n\n'The north? Uh... I'm not too clued in about what Kougon's like, but I hear everyone's pretty old-timey there?'\nWhen Kirara introduced her homeland Higashi to us, she raised the subject of its two ceaselessly warring powers, each one occupying one half of the country, exerting their governances on familially unified grounds.\n'Mitsumoto didn't seem as heavily armed as the guys over there.' When regarding the contrast in power between her own home faction and the opposition, Kirara first skirted around the topic, only conceding after a while that 'if the fight started, then on a face-to-face battlefield it'd be pretty hard to win... b—but, direct conflict isn't the only thing that goes into who wins and loses! Besides, it's not like it's just war and life's on pause. When it comes to economy, openness and good atmosphere—livability, that's it—then it's us who come out on top, right? Uh, not that they're bad or anything, just, that's how I feel about it at least.'\nBeyond this, the Higashi girl also somewhat regretfully, and somewhat barbedly stated:\n'Honestly, if we could just not fight, then let's not. The past few years have been pretty good. Been peaceful for a while. Sometimes I buy games from over there and shinobi even deliver them straight to me. But after I heard about it, it seemed kind of difficult to say. Um. I'm not really sure, I don't get it much myself.'\n'I heard the eight families used to be one, but then they disagreed on something and that's why they've been split across ever since... *sigh* Honestly, isn't it kind of an overdone premise? What's the point? It's just a bunch of brothers infighting, isn't it?'",

Aside from that, music is also one of Kirara's passions; before catching Oripathy, Kirara used to have a part-time job at a bar near her home, and putting on music to fit each day's mood was one of her daily joys.\nPer her own absorptions, Kirara has spent considerable time and energy, even at times near the point of foregoing sleep and food, throwing her whole devotion into games or manga. The shut-off manner in which she refused interaction initially worried people, but as we've spent more time knowing her, we've been quick to realize that it's not that Kirara truly opposes interacting with people, but rather, it's a self-defense mechanism of sorts, stemming from a mentality of fearing being hurt.\nThis fear is closely related to Kirara's experiences as a child. During childhood, her reserved character and her interests unlike those of the children around her led to her being bullied. The experience of being ostracized still has an effect on Kirara to this day; she fears that when she bares her own soul and displays her true self, she may well be rejected or attacked, and so she has preemptively avoided contact with others.\nHowever, should you break past Kirara's inner defenses, and be recognized as a close friend, it'll be clear for anyone to see that the true way she treats people is sincere, passionate, and without any reservation.",

      "desc": "Thank you for purchasing We Will Survive 3 Online. The following is a brief rundown of the game.\n\n■ Primer\nWe Will Survive 3 Online is an RPG that includes both competitive and cooperative gameplay. Players will play as and control different characters in-game, raising their survival rank, and battling with other players to win the Survivals.\nOf course, joining forces will also be necessary throughout many points in the game, so this is a game to enjoy with your friends.\n\n■ Controls\nPlayers must use a controller compatible with the console when controlling their chosen character.\nIf you have multiple people playing, have more controllers ready.\n\n■ Items\nAll items within the game can be obtained either through exploring the wild or through crafting.\nOnce obtained, items can be stored in your backpack. Backpack space is limited, so you can trade any items you don't need at the moment with your friends in-game, and you can opt to just send them as gifts too.\nEach item you collect also unlocks its illustration in the guidebook. If you want to unlock them all and unlock the secret achievement, get trading with players!\n\n■ Competition Phase\nDon't forget, your ultimate goal is victory in the Survivals!\nMerry cooperation goes hand-in-hand with the struggle to compete afterwards! Use your survival skills to contest and loot other players' resources. Out in the wild, you can also lie in ambush, or directly challenge people, initiating one-on-one battles with other players!\nThe higher a player's survival rank, the bigger the advantage in the fight! Decide who amongst you will be the champion of the Survivals!\n\nWith that, you should now have a decent understanding of the game. Invite your friends, plunge into a colorful world, and have a fun time playing together!",
