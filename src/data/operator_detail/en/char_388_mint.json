This isn't to say Operator Mint isn't outstanding; rather, she and Skyfire are two completely separate sorts. She looks quiet and proper at first glance, but in truth she bursts with a curious spirit and a lively step. Compared to her senior Skyfire, a cream-of-the-crop Caster who gained her qualifications from school and promptly graduated, Mint values her research in geological fields much more. \nIt's no surprise that when the time came to decide where she wanted to go, Mint chose to stick around and further her studies, continuing her pursuit of cutting-edge geological research.

Mint usually has the 'book' bound with a specially made tie, so as not to cause any accidents. It's as the rumors say—the book will bite people. If someone randomly flips its pages, they'll very likely set off its built-in retaliative mechanisms. It won't cause any life-threatening harm, but according to Mint, 'Its bites hurt so much. It's even worse than stubbing your little toe.' \nMint says she happened upon the book at an old marketplace near school, where all the shops sold old books and worn knick-knacks that had probably traded hands countless times, and where no shortage of questionably-legal goods moved around under wraps. \n'Don't go in there expecting anything. People who treat it as one great treasure hunt by and large end up buying complete useless rubbish, ' stated Operator Skyfire on this topic. 'If you honest-to-God know how to find something nice, you'll find it. If you can't see a thing's true worth, tough. That's the only way. '",

Though most of the time she comes off simply as polite and sweet, Mint's natural-born curiosity and hunger for knowledge is impossible to hide, and it didn't take long to show once she arrived at Rhodes Island. \nShe spent the first couple of days 'exploring' most areas of the ship provided to Operators, before selecting a few lesser trodden places to act as her own secret bases. She's taken to life at Rhodes Island very quickly. \nHowever, her wildly scattering curiosity has definitely invited trouble at times. \nOne thing that worries people is while doing something, Mint is distractable. Of course, this isn't to say she has no sense of priority. When a directly pressing matter is at hand, Mint focuses and spares no detail until it's done, but the moment the most critical part is finished, she loosens up, and it's then that something else can easily steal her attention. \nFor example, after a mission, she might be lured away by some novel ore or Originium-infected creature, and will wander off from her team without realizing it until she's lost in the dead of the wilderness... That has happened more than once. \nAnd if this continues without any mediation or regulation, we fear that Operator Skyfire, who already loses her temper whenever it happens, will sooner or later burn the ship out from the inside.",

Those are what really matter to her. \nAfter all, geological research has always been part and parcel of all sorts of dangerous environments. No matter the stringent safety measures, no one can guarantee an accident will never occur. Mint and all the researchers with her were all aware of this.

Saga told me that to concentrate on but one thing before thee, one item, be it even the most mundane and unremarkable stone, would settle thee down, and see that thou wouldst ponder the primitive and true. She led me through some meditation, to focus my attention, but eventually... the natto gohan was just too tasty to resist.\nThen comes the forty-third time she's wandered off. Her attention training is declared a failure, and consequently her journaling ends there. The final item noted is a fire extinguisher.\n-FIRE EXTINGUISHER.
