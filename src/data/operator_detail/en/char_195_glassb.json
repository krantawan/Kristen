Once evenly folded in, add the fowl yolk. Dice the dried berries finely (full chunks will be slightly sour). Sift in pastry flour, knead until smooth, then trim and cut into 4 x 4cm squares.\nNB: If these are for Sonya, make bigger. Natalya likes more salt in hers. Drizzle honey for Rosalind's.\nPlace in freezer to rest for 1hr, then transfer straight into a preheated 170°C oven for 20min until done.\n......\nI see... And I thought all along the chief would turn out to be the true mastermind! Now that I look back at previous descriptions, he did plenty that he wouldn't have done otherwise. Blatantly letting the protagonist go on with the investigation, making such a solemn vow at the meeting, and him and his wife truly being in love all along, not a political marriage... He even began by committing suicide...\nThe author's deliberately crafted narrative tricks may have had their impact, but I did still let first impressions blind me to many unusual details.\nIt may be that people truly can be affected by information from all sides given specific circumstances, and end up overlooking facts that should have been obvious.\nI've overlooked a lot, that much is true.\nThis is something I'll have to reflect on frequently in future.\n......\nI've borrowed several books from the Doctor throughout my time here at Rhodes Island. As a student, I've certainly been through things most others my age have not yet. It's beyond me to more deeply comprehend some conundrums posed in books with my current level of knowledge, but with my experiences, perhaps the author's intent is something I can feel out.\nPertinently, the passage on the 'mass' in Chashcha Lesa: 'Those who have done wrong once find they are not punished, for those around them who know of it will opt to turn one's blind eye to carry on living one's 'days of well-being,' so accordingly the wrongdoers will then go to do wrong a second and third time. May there merely be one willing to fix their firm eye and raise their voice, and this chaos can be dispelled.'\nMay there merely be one willing to fix their firm eye and raise their voice, and this chaos can be dispelled.\n\n—Excerpts from Istina's reading notes"
