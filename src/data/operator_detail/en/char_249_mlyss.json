While still in her 20s, she had already emerged as one of Rhine Lab's top ten elites, becoming its Ecological Section's director as well as a guest lecturer at numerous universities in Trimounts. Over the past ten years, Muelsyse and her research team have greatly propelled the development of Columbia's life and environment sciences, having made significant contributions to many fields such as ecology, genetics, phytochemistry, and plant physiology.\nAfter coming to a preliminary agreement, Rhodes Island's Bioengineering Lab and Rhine Lab's Ecological Section quickly began a series of collaborative research projects. These include conducting 'further studies on model organisms,' 'model inference of the paleoecological effects of species' mutation,' 'Burdenbeasts, Originium Slugs, and the environment,' 'experiments on the modification of reproductive traits through molecular biology,' etc... <i>Subjectively</i> speaking, one of the more notable reasons that all these collaborative projects got off the ground so quickly is that both parties' supervisors' unique requirements for experimental environments are shocking similar: in short, 'simple and clean.' Muelsyse came to visit Rhodes Island after we extended an invitation for her to visit our Bioengineering Lab. The moment she stepped into the laboratory, she exclaimed, 'So refreshing.' The next moment, when hit by a stream of air from the air filtration system, her body burst into bubbles while still brandishing a genuine smile, causing even Weedy's eyes to light up. Although the reason Muelsyse tends to work in environments with low concentrations of Originium is fundamentally different from Weedy's mysophobia, they nonetheless share extremely high standards for their laboratories' filtration systems. Naturally, the two of them hit it off right away. With such a great start, it's no wonder they followed it up with so many collaborative projects.\nThis is Rhodes Island's second partnership with a Rhine Lab director; the first being Miss Dorothy Franks. This goes to show that our two companies' relationship is growing deeper by the day. With the future hardly so optimistic, this is beneficial to both companies' continued existence and development.",

Aside from the necessary supporting documents and assurances, she also gave everyone a thick guidebook covering a variety of topics, including 'Holiday Clubs Worth Experiencing,' 'Fashion Shows Worth a Visit,' 'Must-Buy Fashion Accessories,' 'Wrankwood Film Lots and Award Ceremonies to Check Out...' While browsing social media on the Trimounts intercity net, a certain operator well-familiar in the 'ways of the detective' even discovered Muelsyse's anonymous account. In just a year and a half, she made lots of posts and reviews on subjects like fashion, games, and photography. Her comments were thorough and her criticisms harsh, making her reviews very helpful. As can be seen from the large number of views she's amassed.\nOne of the operators who participated in the Bioengineering Lab's collaborative projects also excitedly shared with us his experiences: Once, during the thirty-minute wait for an experiment's outcome, Muelsyse stared intently at the terminal before her. She was frowning as she held tightly onto a slide used in the experiment that was to be disposed of, and there seemed to be nothing but worry in her eyes. He thought that perhaps something had gone wrong with the experiment and decided to take a peek at the screen... only to find her checking out prices on a certain second-hand luxury goods trading platform.\n'I'm buying these things with my hard-earned cash. I'd feel just AWFUL if they ever went down in price!' Director Muelsyse explained.\n'Also, she trains every single day! She jogs fifteen laps around the vivarium every day, very strangely self-disciplined—some researchers even suspect that it's her clone that's doing the jogging, not her in the flesh. And on days when she doesn't have anything scheduled, she even organizes hiking trips. Hard to imagine, huh?!'\n'That's because I get sick easily. Training doesn't help me any with my 'allergies,' but it can at least make me relax.' Director Muelsyse explained.\n'I mean, how do I put it? First impressions can be quite deceiving, you know? But Muelsyse's someone who's really living her life to the fullest.'",

At the time of its inception, she had yet to graduate from college, while Kristen and Saria were running hither and thither to obtain investment for their projects. Although nothing was certain yet, the name 'Rhine' had already appeared in their proposals numerous times. Thanks to a connection through a teacher, Muelsyse came into contact with the two.\nAccording to Muelsyse herself, she has always been the one to naturally pull the team together, ever since its founding. She'd schedule some gatherings and parties between all the experiments, as well as liven up the atmosphere when others were arguing. Rather than a singular company, the five Scientific Research Sections of Rhine Lab are often more like a loose union of companies each with their own ambitions, making Muelsyse's actions seem particularly naive.\n\n[Voice Log]\n'My instructor wasn't too interested in the second investment project, so I went in her place. What a coincidence, though. That night, I heard from a friend from Trenton that they were going to tear down the orphanage in the town. I told you before, but that's where I spent my childhood. It's where I realized what's special about me, and where I began my fruitless pursuit. I wanted to go back and take a look... but I still went to the venture capital fair—I didn't even know what I was supposed to reminisce about. Looking back, it was all a haze, and there was no point in wallowing in self-pity. That's why I had to keep finding my way forward... and just as I wanted, I came to know Kristen and Saria.'\n......\n'Right, my research with Nasti has made an important breakthrough, but we ran into a much more important bottleneck. Both theoretically and technologically... that 'city' was still just a hazy image. As a project, it's nothing but a wild fantasy. The Galleria Stellaria's data may be valuable, but far from enough to be used as its cornerstone. Give up? Yeah, this is quite a headache for me and Nasti, but bottlenecks in the scientific context are nodes that can undergo rapid, qualitative change. Kristen has already proven that we can touch the sky, and we can do more than that. Rhine Lab can do much, much more.\n'You've got that right. Be it reminiscing or stopping fights, I'll keep on doing what I've always done, even if nobody cares... though I guess it's not exactly nobody.'",

Many see this as a talent, but few are aware that, to Muelsyse, this is her innate nature. It's very difficult for her to see everything from the so-called 'normal' perspective. When she noticed your skepticism, Muelsyse calmly gave the following explanation.\nShe picked up a potted plant from your desk, placed it on the coffee table, and asked you to describe to her what it was.\nA plant with a proper scientific name, green leaves, white flowers, pleasing growth. It has just been watered; its soil is moist... That was your response. It was a thoroughly detailed description of the potted plant; an amalgamation of frequently used terminology.\nAnd it was hardly different from the kind of responses Muelsyse would often get.\nNext, she gave a description of the plant she saw.\nFirstly, she used the pronouns 'she' and 'her.'\n<i>She</i> was very healthy. <i>Her</i> entire body's circulation was very stable, although there was a leaf with a tip that clogged up a little. It was likely going to yellow soon.\n<i>She</i> wasn't very happy. <i>Her</i> roots were almost touching the bottom of the pot, but <i>she</i> still wanted to grow. One of the ways that <i>she</i> had been voicing <i>her</i> complaint was by scattering pollen onto your hand.\n<i>Her</i> ancestors lived in a lush forest in a faraway place. A fowlbeast excreted <i>her</i> ancestors' seeds while flying over the nomadic city, and thus the seeds began to spread throughout the city—\nMuelsyse's description contained details far beyond what can be perceived by mere observation, as well as information amalgamated from what she perceived through multiple sensory receptors. Finally, she also went into some unreal, epoch-transcending pedantic information. She seemed very excited. You noticed there was this brief moment after she realized her words could not bear the weight of all this information that she wanted to hold your hand and share something with you. A hazy consciousness began to form in your brain about this flower pot before you—about <i>her</i>.\nBut it did not last very long. Perhaps it would be more appropriate to say it only lasted an instant. Muelsyse instinctively withdrew that odd information transfer.\nYou realized that she must have attempted to build relationships with others in this manner, but not even a genius like Kristen could have sensed any of it, for it is a barrier that cannot be surmounted by other races; it is the source of her loneliness—she cannot share everything she sees with others in its entirety.\nAnd so you tried to describe what she felt with words. She looked surprised, stony, and at a loss. Then, she took your hand. It was an invitation. She yearned to share with you the lands.\nAnd you agreed.",

Square Sunflowers\nAmount: 8\nOrigin: A certain tribe from a forest in central Sami\n......\nRemarks: This type of plant originated from a cold region of Sami that sees little rain. They favor sunlight, and their square corollae always face the sun's direction as their rhizomes continue to grow upward. After they were transplanted to the vivarium, their corollae began to droop. This was much more pronounced this week. They seemed dispirited, but based on the latest examination report, although this behavior may look like the plants have not grown used to their new environment, it is actually because the sunflowers have developed hydrophilicity. They are trying to reach closer to the moist soil around them.\n\n119. Pale Firs\nAmount: 10\nOrigin: ■■■■\n......\nRemarks: The roots of two mature trees have developed a thick, soft layer of fungus. Examination shows that this layer of lichenized fungus grew not because of the humid environment. Instead, it has accurately enveloped the rotting roots. The damaged fiber structures are slowly but clearly recovering. The fungus is like a scab covering the wounds ahead of time, helping the firs heal themselves.\n\n'Right, it's a rare tree to start with. We moved them into the vivarium hoping to improve the species's conservation status. Alas, this was not very effective, but what a pleasant surprise it was to see them undergo such a fundamental change.\n'If it wasn't for you, they would all have drowned...'",

      "desc": "In the early morning, long before the staff of the Ecological Section have come to work, a figure strolls through the vivarium. The vents have just opened, and the entire place quickly fills with mist. The figure remains at ease, briskly skipping about from plant to plant, occasionally tapping at the terminal on her chest before drifting to the next. After a full round, she chucks her terminal into a meeting room with a resounding 'clack' that fades away into nothingness.\n\nBy the break of dawn, a line is already forming before a Trimounts bakery. Though most researchers care about meals only insofar as they fill stomachs and provide nutrition, inevitably a few would prefer to savor their food and drink. She is also in that line, hoping for freshly-baked bread and especially this bakery's salt-crust loaves. She glances at the queue in front of her, then at the big clock across the street. She then calculates how much longer it would take to have her fill of delicious bread...\n\nMuelsyse sits at the dresser, looking at her Dresser Flowing Shape while combing her hair.\nShe has an Ecological internal meeting to attend in half an hour, but there is nary not a hint of worry on her face.\nHer Dresser Flowing Shape acts as a mirror and follows along with her movements. Occasionally, it decides to be a bit impish and changes its posture, to the consternation of its master as she tries to put on her makeup.\nAfter tying up her hair for the day and putting on whatever jewelry she feels like, Muelsyse flings her chapstick into her pocket before giving a wave to her Dresser Flowing Shape, which reverts to a fountain.\nUpon opening the door to her room, she sees some bread atop the table, along with a salad and some water.\n\nShe enters Ecological, a gaggle of researchers surrounds her as she walks towards the meeting room. Newcomers are amazed that the director doesn't even need to glance at her notes before immediately going into presentation mode, while veterans have long since gotten used to this.\nAfter all, she <i>is</i> their director, predicting her actions is like trying to catch the wind.\nAs such, almost none of them could imagine that at this very moment—\nShe is in the vivarium, looking at a dewdrop form on the tip of a leaf.\nShe is by a fountain in a city park, feeding the fowlbeasts.\nShe is in the fountain on her dresser, where she continues to sleep.\nShe is—\n\n'I'm here, drinking coffee with you aboard Rhodes Island.\n'Pretty amazing, right?'\nAfter seeing Muelsyse cross her arms and lift her head with pride, you hurriedly agree. You've seen her impressive abilities up close, although you have noticed a few... oddities in the small details—\nYou've seen her press the wrong button on her terminal, forcing the vivarium staff to take cover from the sudden rain.\nYou've seen her curiously take a bite of the feed in the park while feeding the fowlbeasts.\nYou've even seen her draw an arc across her chin with chapstick.\nSkilled technicians controlling multiple terminals are bound to make mistakes, so it's only natural that Muelsyse would have trouble with multiple Dresser Flowing Shapes, right?\nBut when you recall the sight of her stirring the air above her coffee cup, you can't help but laugh.\nAs a result, and rightfully so, you suffer a one-two punch from Muelsyse's Dresser Flowing Shape.",
