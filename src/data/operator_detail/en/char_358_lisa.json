Despite the unfortunate fact that Lisa was infected at such a young age, she still has such a strong and pure aspect to her that I can't even begin to comprehend what her parents went through to shield her from that kind of environment. However, because of that, Lisa lacks some basic knowledge regarding the Infected. Perhaps we should seriously consider educating Lisa about these subjects, which may leave her feeling confused and sad. However, it would also avoid the inevitable pain and trauma that will come with her status as an Infected, at some point in the future. \nEven if we exaggerate a little bit. If Rhodes Island is unable to even guide these Infected children down the correct paths so that they can understand their destiny and choose the life that is right for them, can we really seek to break the status quo of the Infected simply through medical treatment? \nOf course, Lisa may also show us the bright future that lies ahead.

Suzuran's father is a kannushi, or priest, who built a small name for himself in a certain city-state in Higashi. In light of recent situations and the vast distance between Higashi and Siracusa, it is hard to imagine how Suzuran's parents met, fell in love, and then had their daughter, Lisa. Suzuran inherited her mother's hair color and facial features, but she also inherited the sacred bloodline of her father, seen through her nine tails. At one point, this trait made Suzuran recognized as heir to her father's priesthood status, but her father did not intend to allow his daughter to be shackled to the family's endless shrine duties. While he firmly believed that what he did brought succor to the people, he clung onto selfish hopes that his daughter could have a broader, freer future. As such, Suzuran was secretly taken to Siracusa by her mother, but the peaceful times did not last long. Her mother's family was involved in a bout of civil unrest against the ■■■■ family. During this uprising, Suzuran, who was recognized as her mother's weak point, was injured during a certain plot when a shard of originium hidden within a stuffed doll cleanly pierced her left arm. One can imagine how remorseful Suzuran's mother felt as a result of this incident; after entrusting Suzuran to Rhodes Island, her mother personally led an assassination attempt against the assailant's family, and has not been heard from again since. \nAs for how we learned about these inside stories that are rarely known even inside the city-states of Siracusa... we must keep Lisa a secret.",

Yet despite that, they were able to smuggle a nine-tailed Vulpo out of the isolated Higashi, even though she was identified to be a successor. In Siracusa, they managed to maintain a good education for her within the chaotic and predatory environment of Siracusa. \nWhat makes them so strong? \nLisa has received only basic courses on Originium Arts in Rhodes Island, but considering her age, even these courses are far beyond the norm. Lisa would often burn the edges of her dress because of her poor control over her Originium Arts, trying to put up a smile in front of concerned operators. After all, not everything can be explained away by 'naivete.' The success and progress she achieved was not due to either her 'pedigree' or her 'innate talent.' She may still be a child, but as with Amiya, do not overlook her inner fortitude. Lisa has been working hard silently, and has also been growing silently. That is a power that she has always possessed, without us needing to tell her about our ideals, the times, or the grand propositions for Terra. She does not need us to underestimate her, let alone coddle her. Let Lisa see both the beauty and cruelty of this land, and I dare say that every person who claims to want to protect Lisa will be protected by this strong child in the end.",

It won't work anymore if you do.'\nShe knew what its internals were, really. It was a simple thing. Figured out with just a touch and some general knowledge.\nBut she chose to believe, and wait.\nDay, after day.\nFinally, one noon, the tremoring inside her personal pouch stopped.\nHer mom suddenly showed up behind her, and her dad was carrying a massive bag, his face filled with the gentle smile she so missed.\nPromises are something this couple never neglects.\nThe family briefly reunited on Rhodes Island, and spent several days and nights worth remembering.\nBut very quickly, they once again bid farewell.\nThis time, her father solemnly read out a prayer and opened the sealed omamori, while her mother carefully examined the watch face, and wound the pocket watch's spring.\nThey finished their parts, and soon asked Suzuran to tie the omamori's rope tight.\nThis simple, unadorned ceremony did not go on for long, but it was a concentrative, serious matter for all.\nA kannushi, an assassin, an operator.\nA father, a mother, a daughter.\nThrough this tiny omamori, the three's souls were bound together tight as could be.\nIt is respect, through which promises are kept.\nIt is trust, through which endurance is willing.\nThe land throws them far apart.\nBut love transcends space and time, granting them the power to meet again.\n'Once this omamori no longer tick-tocks, we'll be back with you.'\n'Until then, remember to go to bed on time~'\n'Mm-hm!'\n'Have a safe journey, mom, dad!'",

      "desc": "Suzuran catches sight of two tense Medic operators, one wearing a hazmat suit, the other carrying a refuse bag, both at the door to the playroom waiting to strike. The chain of events isn't complicated: a damaged doll, an agitated child, a failed casting attempt, and now a toy meant to be fixed by Arts is instead skewered by a sinister Originium crystal. Suzuran passes by to see the boy hugging it, wailing, forbidding anyone from taking it away.\n'It just grew some rocks! It didn't do anything bad! It's not dangerous!'\nSuzuran once had a doll too, but a much daintier one, in a little blue coat and stuffed with fluffy musbeast fur. It, too, grew a crystal like his—and she'd just nodded off holding it when a stabbing pain pulled her violently from dreamland.\n'I saved it from the rubbish bin, I saved it! You can't throw it away again!'\nSuzuran doesn't remember that night too well, but she does remember nestling in the faint warmth of her mother's arm, and the doctor's soft, gentle voice. Nothing taken for processing, nothing thrown away. The next morning, an identical doll sat on her bed, no hint of damage.\n'Mum and Dad were like this when they got taken away! Everything gets taken away, and just buried... Why are you scared of me? Why are you scared of our stuff?!'\nSuzuran has just as little idea why. That's not how things happened in her life. But, she thinks, maybe she can get things to change to the way she recognizes. So, ignoring the Medic operators trying to stop her, Suzuran walks up to the boy, and tells him a story.\n\n'H-Hello... I don't think this doll's actually dangerous at all...'\n'Really? You think so too?'\n'Yeah. These stones are amber from another land—look, you can even see through them. The people with stones on them, in the end they bury inside those stones to sleep, just like bugs do in amber. And then when they wake up, they journey to the other land.'\n'I knew those meanies were lying to me! They didn't say anything except 'they're dead', and nobody explained. They just kept on going on about 'dead means dead,' so I think they just didn't know either!'\n'Er, I... I don't know if they know or not, but the other land is real... When people grow stones and then disappear, that means they've journeyed over there. Right now they're lying in golden lakes, basking in the nicest, warmest sunlight.'\n'Then are we going too one day?'\n'We are, but you have to go to sleep properly, because that's how the journey succeeds. See, the doll can't fall asleep right now, because it's too noisy in here. So, can you let it rest in peace?'\n\nThereafter, in the rec room there sits a doll in a glass case, with a wrinkled note stuck on the outside: On a journey, do not disturb.",
