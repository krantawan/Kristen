'After one night, all that remained was the lunatic who cried and begged for anyone to ferry him back to the mainland. Anyone who refused would be subjected to a flurry of fists, and this went on for so long that in time, few dared approach the island.' \nSimilar legends to the above were once sung about a town built around a lake in western Siracusa. This is not a legend in the sense of a superstition passed down, but rather a summary of chilling events that occurred one after another over a period of 3-4 years in a mansion built in the middle of the lake. After fully exploring this 'cursed island,' a few courageous investigators and explorers were only able to bring back a young girl who seemed to be a blood relative with the island's owner, along with some attendants who had been shocked into a near-comatose state.",

More accurately, this area isn't actually underground, but refers to a depth that can be easily reached through plowing or farming. Present here is a large amount of active Originium. Prolonged exposure to this Originium-dense environment unknowingly awakened Originium Arts within the young girl, and prolonged contact through potable water, food, wound sites, etc., further exacerbated her rampant and uncontrollable Arts. After learning about this situation, Miss Shamare was quickly transferred to the Rhodes Island landship for medical treatment and management. Although the locals were more than happy to send away this 'plague god' as if they were saved, we know that Miss Shamare is but another victim of this incident. \nMiss Shamare is still a child, even younger than Amiya is. I hope all of you keep this in mind. Her rampant Originium Arts is vastly more noteworthy than her experiences as an Infected. Originium Arts that can manipulate the consciousness of others often comes with a greater burden upon the user. We would do well to keep thorough records while investigating.",

She often uses the doll she always keeps on her, which she calls 'Morte,' to express her thoughts. In addition, Shamare also demonstrates interests that are incomprehensible to others, frequently talking to herself using antiquated jargon. At first, Medics thought this was possibly a symptom of contracting Oripathy at such a young age. Later on, when visiting the attendants who were responsible for taking care of Shamare, we found that many of them did not blindly heed the myths and rumors, and even after becoming aware of the various possibilities, still chose to regard Shamare with malice and ill will. While most of them have expressed regret for these sentiments, the truth is that every time they would leave the island, they would quietly plead with the ferrymen to take them away. When they got into town, they were often viewed as accomplices to some horrific crime even though they were merely shopping, a testimony to the unfair treatment they would receive. Understandably, no amount of good intentions can offset the withering bombardment of negativity. \nOver time, the townspeople who didn't know the truth came to establish the dominant narrative, and even the attendants who had stayed with the young girl for many years started to view her in the same light. Overall, it can be said that the effect of the environment and her upbringing played a far greater role in the development of Shamare's character than Oripathy itself.",

She still attributes everything that happens around her to evil spirits, or the words and deeds of 'Morte.' Gradually, some of the younger Operators began to wonder if the supernatural phenomena that frequently occurred around Shamare actually had some credence... Although our current understanding of Originium is not enough to explain all the secrets of Terra, it is nevertheless highly undesirable to simply categorize the unknown as 'curses.' We hope that all Operators will try their best to remain sensible and approach Miss Shamare with a normal mindset, as this too provides valuable guidance to her education. We should all think rationally about the 'supernatural events' happening around Shamare, and believe that there are naturalistic explanations for these phenomena...\nAddendum: So far, no one has fully elucidated Shamare or the mystery of her Originium Arts. Yet nevertheless... all we can do is believe that these are indeed due to Originium Arts. Looking back, yet more rumors circulate regarding that Siracusan lake... and there are discrepancies between what those stories describe and what we've managed to test Shamare for.

At first, we thought that her references to 'divinations' and 'curses' were coping mechanisms to deal with her environment over time or perhaps due to the fact that her Arts subconsciously harmed others in the area, resulting in her attributing everything to the work of evil spirits in order to understand what was happening around her. \nBut based upon Shamare's performance in some missions, as well as bits of data gathered from Originium Arts tests, we were all surprised to find that Shamare's Originium Arts do far more than strongly influence the consciousness of others. Notably, she borrows the spells of 'Morte' to inflict observable physical damage to enemies. Are mental suggestions strong enough to cause deviations in a target's brain function, enough so to cause rupture and hemorrhaging? Although this hypothesis is quite tantalizing, it is fundamentally a fantasy from the perspective of modern Originium Arts technological research. Even more strikingly, her predictions and divinations are sometimes surprisingly accurate. For example, the last time we secretly replaced the Originium fiber filling inside Morte with ordinary cotton, she very unhappily divined the misfortunes that would befall a number of us. Some of these predictions included taking a fall from a chair breaking, getting hit by an unknown passing-by Sankta, and getting lacerated by broken test tube fragments - all of which came true! There's a bruise on my head, you say? Hm? And this is because we're supposedly already affected by her spiritual suggestions...? \nThat... can't be right, can it? Ahem... We've got to have a bit more trust in our patients, don't we! Even if Shamare can't fully control her powers at times, there's no way she'd be able to influence the entire research team without our notice, right? At least the recorder should be able to remain objective about this! \nMore importantly, whose dumb idea was it to give her a doll with that weird Originium stuffing anyway? Don't you know it's dangerous to give Originium-based products to Shamare? ...I approved it? Seriously... I did?",

Clenched and then opened, the palm is just big enough to hold an apple.\nShe senses the emotions of the people around the girl. If she is met with anxious fear, then the girl is met with indifference, mingled with a hint of disgust to be precise, as if that human-shaped body was never meant to belong to their kind.\n'Have you ever eaten an apple?' she asks. The girl shakes her head.\nShe herself rarely gets to eat apples, but at least she knows what they taste like. The servants occasionally bring them, leaving them at the door for her to take.\nThe girl might have only glimpsed apples from afar or heard of them in passing.\nAfter thinking for a moment, she looks at the servant accompanying her, but remains distant. She walks toward the servant, gathers her courage, and says,\n'I... want an apple.'\nNo threats, no curses, she learned to express her thoughts directly, just like everyone else.\nThe servant's eyes widen, his hand trembling, until he screams and flees.\nA few days later, a rumor spreads through the town: the girl on the island is using apples in her curses. The ninety-year-old lady of the Romano family was suddenly bedridden, or the eldest daughter of the Buccellati family couldn't find a husband. All due to malicious curses. People in town quickly hide their apples, and even objects shaped like apples, to ensure that no apple would reach that cursed island.\nShe waited a long time, but never got the apples. The disappearance of the apples showed her that she could never be like those people.\nShe is different.\n'Curse you... all of you...'\nOne day, while cleaning, a servant at the mansion stumbles upon a felt apple with nails driven deep into it. He thinks of the apples he bought a few days ago and the headaches he has been suffering. He breaks out in a cold sweat. As more and more felt apples are found throughout the mansion, a terrifying rumor sweeps through the town once more.\n'The curse falls upon anyone with apples.'\nFor a while, everyone in town abandons their apples. Crates of apples are dumped into the lake, ripe apples are thrown into the streets. Someone suggests changing the town's name to 'Nonappleton,' to unanimous approval.\nOn a pitch-black night, she sneaks to the shore and picks up an apple that floated downstream. She takes a gentle bite, the sweet juice flowing down her throat.\nThat night, she enjoys a rare good dream. She dreamed of the girl on the street eating a bright red apple."
