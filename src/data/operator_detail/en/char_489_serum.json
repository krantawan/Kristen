We were initially somewhat perplexed by these evaluations, but after practical observation of Operator Corroserum's MO, we somewhat understand why they said what they did.\nWith a fine condition, Operator Corroserum is able to complete work assigned to him at a bewildering speed, attaining in line with required quotas, but on the flip side, he will not exceed his quotas. And after that—he'll put on his eye mask, lie back in his office chair, and begin his break at his desk full of reports just freshly inked to completion. Coworkers unfamiliar with him might misconstrue this; only related personnel actually aware of the work allotted to him know it's not because his workload is lower than others'.\nBut if it weren't for a necessity of duty, Operator Corroserum wouldn't lend a hand to his still-busy colleagues in his spare time, or submit proposals to improve the project. He simply takes it as granted that assigned work should be completed, whether the subject is himself or others.",

Of course, I won't be leaking any specific information on its purchasers.'\nPeople admittedly have misgivings about corrosive weapons, and it's hard to imagine that Raythean Industries' technology can actually develop a corrosive able to affect multiple common metals, disintegrate their structures, cause weapons and defenses to lose sufficient dependable function, and simultaneously guarantee its harmlessness to the human body.\nBut Raythean has guaranteed its safety in our contract, and we've attempted our own verifications within the labs. Our results may be surprising, but reasonable: this corrosive itself by no means has sufficient corrosive power, and its customized Arts Unit provides it amplification and direction—but this is only a rational explanation drawn from combining experimental results and information provided to us by them. We have no right to reverse-engineer, and we might not even be able to.\nThis handling method unarguably elevates the product's safety and technological secrecy, and has effectively met the requirements issued by the buyers to Raythean: negate enemy equipment while ensuring enemy forces can be captured alive and intact.",

Contrary to what many of us imagined, it's more often devoted to anti-corrosion tech and raising of product lifespan and reliability. Moreover, things aren't as cut-and-dry as that.\n'Raythean Industries—no... any firm that receives orders for arms or equipment has to consider the issue of product durability, but no company would outright attempt research of anything 'long-lasting' or 'indestructible.' Granted, armies attached to higher authorities, e.g. Kazimierz's Silverlance Pegasi, don't fall under this. But in this era of rapid technological development, there's no motive for fighting forces requiring power to spend so much on custom equipment that can last for more than, say, three years. In my opinion, providing these projects with technological support is just a waste—project teams will even demand I appropriately lower the final product's durability, until it just so perfectly tips the line the stakeholders want, so they'll come and order something new next time. After running into these requirements time and time again, I stopped pointlessly squandering my care on those cheap things, and that, maybe, is why I didn't appeal to certain people. So it went until now, joining this 'Raythean Warbreaker' R&D team.'\nWhat Operator Corroserum brought up here seemed far from under any strict NDA or classification, and we can assume the company had no reason to treat it as such, even if Rhodes Island has hit walls running into similar problems throughout its medical manufacturing pipeline and sales fronts. After all, whether in its internal or external affairs, every firm as a matter of course has its troubles and schemes. The current situation may not be requisitely optimistic, but we can only press forward through the mud with all we have.",

From his project background, we can glean his fondness of choosing assistance roles; according to him, this lets him both avoid all flavors of difficult leadership and admin, and lets him comprehensively participate in project exhibition, the role of steering project goals and core technologies perhaps something he considers his home.\nAfter arriving at Rhodes Island, the seemingly negligent look he's projected may just be his boredom from having no place to display his talents to his heart's content.\nIn regards to Operator Corroserum, in our paper agreements with Raythean, we obviously only have purview for work on relevant projects.

But none of this held Operator Corroserum back from wielding knowledge in his expert fields. He rapidly produced technical prototypes for a coating able to resist this corrosive, and in a short span of time, had it realized and put into practice. He explains this technology's greatest hurdle wasn't resisting the corrosive itself, but vying to make it just as harmless to the human body, in order to directly spray it on friendly equipment, lowering the upfront cost of using this weapon.\nHowever, this project's manager later proposed another scenario: an enemy might just as well develop or steal this protective coating technology. Thus, he required Corroserum develop a corrosive that could get past this coating.\nAnd not just that, but given the possibility this new corrosive technology could also be re-engineered or stolen, there may also be a need to proceed with developing technology that could withstand this corrosive in turn...\nAnd following this, there might also...\nEr, maybe we can try inferring at this point why Operator Corroserum chose to trial this weapon at the project's tail end, and provisionally leave a team where he could show his true strengths for once.",

      "desc": "Let me tell you a very boring story.\nThere are countless middle-class Columbian children living plainly favorable lives, who still attempt to assert their own individuality via what rebelliousness they've learned from others. Our hero for today is one such case.\nThe kids downtown never seem to exhaust their creativity or energy. Their skate tricks, graffiti art, and street rap hold a certain peculiar charm. No need for any means of intercity communication; it flourishes naturally in any urban center. Even the private school kids are captivated by this downtown 'ruff 'n' tuff stuff,' but discipline from their parents or teachers usually keeps them steering clear. They don't go out and experience the cool stuff for themselves.\nSo, our hero? His parents weren't for or against, they just didn't care, because our hero was a step ahead of the rest of his year. In whatever time was his own, he'd run off to hang out with those kids, but never actually joined in any of their activities. Maybe he was scared his classmates would mock him? Maybe he was scared that doing anything alongside the Infected would bring him trouble? Maybe he knew he wasn't like those kids, and in his heart raged all manner of emotions with nowhere to pour them? Who knows. All we know is that after the city passed a few new regulations quite unfriendly to the Infected, he put his self-taught knowledge to use and provided those kids some special new graffiti paints. If you ever tried to use water or any ordinary solvent to clean those walls, fresh anti-City Hall obscenities would show up over the works to disappoint you.\nYou think this story's actually veering on being interesting? Heh. Wait until I'm done. Yes, there's still more.\nYears later, those downtown kids are grown-ups now, saddled with what City Hall gave them, including the 'necessities for life' bundled along with their experimental weapons. They're on Pioneer Teams. I hear the forces they're part of took down a group of wicked barbarians like they were spraypainting across a map, opening up an ideal site for Columbia to build a nomadic city. The street culture they once also pioneered hasn't vanished since their departure, either. You could even say it's popular among all the youth of the city now, as a form of recreation.\nAnd what of our hero, you ask? He left the city, and never again encountered any graffiti from the throes of the heart, or skateboards in hand-painted livery. He found a job, and spends day in and day out either making more efficient weapons for his customers, or researching how to more efficiently destroy them.",
