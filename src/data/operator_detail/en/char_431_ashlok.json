Here, they could live a new life, and fight for the Infected.\nNevertheless, Greynuty still felt at a loss.\nShe needed a goal.\nShe once strove to sharpen herself for the sake of her family; after becoming Infected, her goal was to ascend the Major and the Champion's throne like the Radiant Knight and the Blood Knight had done; now, she followed Sona, followed the others of Pinus Sylvestris, and came aboard Rhodes Island as an employee of a pharmaceutical company. She would range far from Kazimierz, fighting unlike a knight, or even a Kazimierzian.\nThe rules she was familiar with would no more be applicable.\nAnd so, at present, she is still bewildered, and still vexed.\nBut please don't worry.

Though both were Zalaks, and were born in similar places, their first time meeting came entirely by accident. Not long after the Infected Knights Act was passed, Greynuty was expelled from her family, arriving at the Grand Knight Territory to participate in brutal underground knight competitions. Right before a group melee, she first met Flametail Sona, who wanted a temporary alliance with her for the group match; Greynuty agreed. Just like that, the cannoneer and the swiftblade covered each other's weaknesses, standing out in the tumult of the melee. Once they were left alone on the field, Sona made a thrust at Greynuty, taking the points she had.\nAs a knight, Greynuty ought to have been angered, but in Sona, she found a long-lost trust and peace of mind, as well as Greynuty's own guilt towards her—Sona was once one of the subjects of the Kaliska family, but when a Catastrophe assaulted her home, the Kaliskas never fulfilled their duty as knight nobles. Ultimately, Sona's hometown fell into ruin, and she was Infected.\nAfter that, Greynuty, together with Sona, founded Pinus Sylvestris Knightclub, competing in matches for prize money on one hand, and aiding the Infected of the Grand Knight Territory on the other. They've tried working by themselves, they've tried making deals with the Adeptus Sprawiedliwi, and now, they've found an even better collaborator than before.",

She rarely participates in commercial activities, and she reads every letter from her supporters one by one in detail, writing a reply for each. When she's spotted out and about; fans gather around excitedly asking for signatures, which seems to put Greynuty at a complete, flustered loss, looking to quiet them down as quickly as she can. She then pulls the fans away from the crowd, asks in a stammer what they're looking for, and signs her name on the objects the fans hand her. Her antics have inadvertently garnered her a good number of fanatics; Sona even suggests on occasion that she ought to pursue the path of the idol knight, teasing that her prospects might be greater than as a competition knight. Of course, each time Sona says it, Greynuty sternly declines.\nGreynuty's combat ability is by no means lacking. Preeminent even in Pinus Sylvestris, many an opponent has fallen under her baptism by shellfire. However, she has her weaknesses too—heavy artillery and thick armor consume her endurance, and she moves relatively slowly when fighting the enemy in close quarters, plus the fatal gap that switching spent magazines produces. So long as these problems remain undealt with, and she doesn't temper herself as all-around as a Champion of the Major would, then there will always be a knight who seizes on her weaknesses, and she'll be unable to take the final steps to arrive at her goals.",

            "storyText": "Those familiar with Greynuty know she brims with hatred for the knight nobles. However, Greynuty once was one herself.\nGreynuty's family used to be quite well-known, but after her grandmother passed away, the elders in charge of running the family enterprise made a strategic blunder, and the whole business was left with a deep deficit, and set the family's decline in stone. It was at this time, too, that Greynuty caught Oripathy.\nAfter the fact, there was a change in the way her relatives treated her.\nHer siblings who she'd played with since childhood broke off contact, her few friendly uncles gradually fell out of touch, and her family's elders seemed to forget about her entirely.\nOne common voice held in the Kaliskas' hearts: 'The Kaliskas shouldn't have Infected. So long as Greynuty remains, our prestige will suffer.'\nIn the wake of the family's continued destitution, the way its members regarded her turned slowly from silence to anger. She'd seen how her elders shamed the estate's Infected, but never imagined that as a part of the family, Oripathy would subject her to such treatment.\nEven more unbelievable to her was that the Knight Primus seemed to want her, an Infected, gone from the family.\nIt was like she was no Kaliska, only some homeless commoner blighted by Oripathy, of a village razed in a disaster.\nThis doubt was quickly dispelled, but reality was more ruthless than her mind—she might have even lost the freedom to stay in her home.\nOne day, the Knight Primus summoned her to discuss how to resolve a certain matter. The one who passed it on was highly tactful, but she was well aware, she was that so-called 'matter'.\nAfter a knock on the Primus' parlor door, Greynuty found the Knight Primus of the Kaliskas—along with another noble Knight Primus.\nThey were presumably in talks; the atmosphere was utterly fractured, both sides menacing, trying to wrest more benefit from the other, and here in his parlor, it seemed Greynuty's Knight Primus had readily surrendered every last bargaining chip he'd held.\nThe other noble Primus flew into sudden fury on seeing Greynuty, denouncing the Kaliskas for harboring an Infected, and even bringing her before him. He tore up the treaty, and swore he would no longer work with the Kaliskas.\nGreynuty knew the other side had only used her appearance to wash himself of any blame for the ruined contract, but her Knight Primus, and her family's elders, lacked total awareness of it, going so far as to cast all their rage directly on her.\nIn the end, on a moonless night, the Primus convened a full meeting, deciding by vote whether Greynuty, the Infected, was to go.\n——It was unanimous.\nNo one present dissented; no one so much as abstained. Even Greynuty's mother and father raised their hands.\nGreynuty knew they had sorrows of their own, but in that moment, she felt her own teardrops as they ran down her face.\nThose who sympathized with her said nothing, those who detested her cheered, and the Primus sat at the head of the table feigning impartiality.\nThese were the Kaliskas, a microcosm of Kazimierz's knight nobility.\nSince then, Greynuty has left her home and come alone to the Grand Knight Territory, fighting upward from the underground arenas step by step. Through the knight competitions, she wants to recover her reputation, and thus return to that decrepit and hollowed-out family, give them a good long look at her accomplishments, make them admit they were wrong about her, make them wash off the stigma forced onto her.\nBut what comes afterward?\nSona has given it thought, but she still hasn't.",

Regrettably, before Greynuty finished this course, her grandmother laid on her sickbed never to wake again, and while her elders once solemnly vowed to finance Greynuty's studies, they never made good on their commitment. In the end, Greynuty could only teach herself, diligently rounding off the remainder of the course.",

Greynuty hesitated for a moment before finally taking a step onto it.\n'Slippery, very slippery, you could fall.' That was the first thought that popped into her head.\nImmediately thereafter, the second thought emerged: 'It might be fun, if I don't fall.'\nThrough her sunglasses, Greynuty cautiously surveyed her surroundings. The street was long, offering considerable distance for a run-up. It was also deserted, with no one to witness her.\n'One, two, three!' Taking a few steps back, she braved the cold wind and sprinted forward, accelerating as she went, then abruptly halted, letting momentum carry her forward in a slide.\nShe then started running again, heading toward the other end of the long street. One meter, two meters, three meters... The speed of her running and sliding increased with each attempt, and her heart rate accelerated with the rhythm of her sprint, bringing a sense of weightlessness. The lightness of her body felt almost as if she were floating down a flowing river.\nThe river of time.\n'Don't be afraid, try to go faster, we'll catch you.' In a trance, amidst the whistling wind in her ears, she heard a familiar encouragement. Similar scenes awakened from dusty childhood memories. At the end of the road, a couple smiled and opened their arms to her.\nSo this time, she began to sprint with all her might, only to be brought back to reality by a stone under her foot.\nAfter plunging headfirst into a snowdrift by the roadside, she didn't rush to get up, but instead held her face in her hands. Unsure whether she'd grazed her eyebrow or cheek, she felt a dampness around her eyes.\n'Need a hand getting up, Ashley?' A figure blocked the setting sun, reaching out to her.\n'How did you end up here?' She placed her hand in hers.\nShe stood up, brushed the snowflakes off herself, and picked up her sunglasses and hat that had scattered nearby.\n'You went out for some beer. But it was getting late and you didn't come back, so I was worried. Had to come out to check on you.'\n'*Cough* I'm fine.'\n'Don't lie, your eyes are really red.'\n'The sun's just too bright.'\n'The sun's down.'\n'...Thanks for helping me up.' She put her hat and sunglasses back on, covering her reddened eyes and cheeks.\n'You're welcome.'\n'Oh, actually, there's no point in you arming up like that, Ashley.'\n'Why not?'\n'That shop on the corner there has a special window. You can't see in from the outside, but you can see out from the inside.'\n'So you mean...'\n'Yep... chock full of people. I even saw a few of your fans in there.'"
