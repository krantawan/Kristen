In the words of a rare angered Closure, 'even if he is just a shadow, he should never be allowed to board the landship without permissions ever again. It's just far too arrogant.' \nPhantom was quite frank about his work as an independent assassin. As the general public is quite aware of the nature of this profession, this quiet assassin from Victoria usually keeps a low profile and has few words to say, even after becoming an employee. Phantom has also disclosed little about his prior experiences. \nAccompanying Phantom on his arrival to Rhodes Island was a person as mysterious and alluring as the night itself, someone known as 'Ms. Christine.' Through her demeanor, it was clear that she was a refined and haughty woman. No one knows whether she will remain or leave, and she is not always seen with Phantom, instead happy enough to wander around as if quietly patrolling her turf. \n\nAppendix\nThree suggestions when encountering Ms. Christine:\n1. Never touch Ms. Christine. Wait for her to approach, and accept when she leaves. \n2. Show a respectful attitude towards her, as if deferring to a beautiful maiden. \n3.

By using his throat to vocalize certain sounds, he is able to interfere with and severely damage the psyche of a living being. The more intense the emotion in the tone, the deeper the effect is, producing psychological damage that is difficult to repair or reverse. \nConsidering the operator's special circumstances and his personal desires, Phantom's infection monitoring device has been modified by the R&D Department to be equipped with special functions that can suppress his infection symptoms to ensure that he is able to live a normal life in Rhodes Island without hindrances.",

He may have had a wonderful voice in the past, but as he is now, he could not be further from the stage. \nEven in Rhodes Island, there are many operators who have never directly met Phantom, with some insisting that there is no such operator named Phantom at all. Currently, only a small handful of people actually have any understanding of this operator. \nAs an aside, the only time I came in contact with Phantom was when I was looking for the Doctor prior to writing this file. I was only able to find Phantom through the Doctor. \n\n'Indeed, I've heard some rumors about this 'troupe' and what happened behind the scenes. \nI can also tell you about the impressions I now have about him, but it may not be of any use to you, because there's a good chance you won't listen. \nBut if you insist?

And indeed, everything here seems to have been forgotten... Seeing this photo should make that clear enough. It's just like one of those fabled ghost towns. All the residences, facilities, and public spaces have been preserved as is, including the troupe's tents stationed in the park, just like in the records - the only thing that's missing are the residents. \n\nThe live video of the troupe's performance has been completely destroyed, and the machinery left behind is broken beyond repair. However, we did locate a main console far from the stage, where we managed to recover some damaged documents and externally backed-up data. \nDespite our painstaking efforts to restore the damaged data, the contents are just a jumbled mess. The best way to describe it is as if a piece of cake was sealed within a plastic bag, then thrown into a fervent crowd at an Iberian festival. What we managed to recover is pretty similar to whatever would be left in that bag afterwards. As for the portion of the data that was sent out, the path was too vague and could not be tracked. \n\nIn order to verify the content, we played a portion of the video footage that could be considered somewhat intact. While doing so, three of the investigators present experienced degrees of psychological disturbance, so we were forced to temporarily seal off the remaining files. \nWhat exactly happened back then? And who exactly would want to preserve such a scene, and why? \nI dare not entertain the possibilities in my head, for they would be inconceivable. \n\n[Video File - Encrypted]\n[Encrypter - Kal'tsit]\n[Danger Level - 3]\n'■■■stage, death■■■■behind■■■loop, song■■, ■■■■end, all■begin.'",

With cup cradled, he stares out at the emptiest street in gold, squints ever so slightly, and under the loop of his collar the crystals at his throat, grown distinct these recent evenings, faintly stings. \nHe remembers the ringleader, who rarely shows in person beyond giving him instruction, raising the matter with him not long ago. \nComing with praise, eager to see the day he truly joins. \nSaying, I hope you reserve nothing for this play. \n—It will be his stage alone. \nAt times, the performer feels a whisper of anxiety, source unknown. But beneath that unease pallid as the Victorian mist, it is clear to realize for him that he cannot hold back the feeling of joy. \nThis will be no ordinary play, a play like no other the traveling troupe has hitherto performed, unlike any stage he has trodden before. \nThis will be his play, and his entire life, his kismet... \n\n'Mew.' \nA black kitten appears on the street corner. Few have seen a being beautiful as it, as if a certain legend where at times they show before others as they please, a legend as if the black cat here now. \nThe performer's train of thought is broken. The uncanny fervor in his eyes dissipates, and his look relaxes, watching the cat delicately pace towards him, and he lets out a smile unawares. \nHe is in love with coming to this little town's street corner these days. On it there are few, and it is calm, and the tea is not exceptional, but a black cat does always patron it, placing golden sunsets underfoot with its perfect composure, on its leisurely stroll. \n'Meow.' \nIts tail elegantly sways, approaches his side. \nThe performer tries to reach a hand out to the black cat, and it gives an askance look, its ears shake a shiver, but it does not show immediate refusal. Thus he carefully strokes its finely sheened fur, the sunset that lingers on this kitten soaking into his fingertips. \nHis smile supplants all other mood in his vision; the performer has long since had a fine name in mind for his unusual new friend, and merely has not given it yet. \nHe has decided, if this black cat keep coming forevermore, he will ask her: would you like to walk with me?",

      "desc": "What is death?\nThe teachers described it thus: dramatic, unexpected, shrouded.\nA character's death was artistic, and by and large the play's climax. A heartracing, fascinating thing.\nThe audience hoped for it so—sensuously, madly, excitedly, rapturously...\nThey were drunk, doped on the stories that lead up to those deaths.\nArt, all for art.\nSo he was taught; so he held.\nAs he witnessed with his own eyes his teachers demonstrate to him such artistic deaths, one after another, so too did he experience the emotions behind those deaths.\nHe was a child of art. He knew himself, believed himself, and considered himself born unto the stage.\nAnd yet. Yet—\nThe moment he truly took the stage as the star, the moment he ushered in the very first production he owned, the moment he could truly exhibit the technique cut into every bone of his body, the moment the sharpened edge would play with grace across the artery—\nHe came to realize with open eyes his own opinion—death was simply death, no more.\nIt held no artistry. It bore no hope. Its only meaning was the passing of a life.\nIn that moment, everything changed.\nThe art once held aloft was lofty no longer. The hopes once shouldered became barbs upon his back. His teachers were no teachers now, but murderers.\nAh, indeed. Mere murderers.\nAnd he, a mere murderer too.\nThe performers upon the stage, the spectators off it, all simply murderers.\nBut in every story, murderers should receive their just desert in the end.\nThe familiar weight upon his shoulders stops his racing mind. It is the black cat. He tilts his head, and she stares right back.\nEver since they met, she has frequented his side. At times, even he knows not how the black cat manages to slip close to him.\nTo him, tonight is a night of utmost importance. And so, he asks the question.\n'Would you walk with me?'\nThe black cat licks at her paws, yawns, and seems to entirely lack interest in the question.\n'How would the name... Christine strike you?'\n'Meow.'\nThe black cat—no—Miss Christine now seems much more enthused. With a few short hops she descends from the windowsill, and turns back to glance at him. Oddly, the notion strikes him that Miss Christine is concerned for him.\n'Don't worry.'\nYes. Do not worry.\nHis decision has been ever resolute.\nThe curtain slowly opens, the spotlights hang above center stage, the seats below are packed, and all await the play with high hopes.\nTo center stage, he paces.\nFor murderers, a trial at times comes from a place of righteous anger, and at others from introspective guilt, but all are equal in their exit from the stage.\nHe clears his throat.\nTonight, death will come equal.",
