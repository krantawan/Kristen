She failed to divine that her own sister would contract the disease in an accident during an experiment, nor did she see that she herself would be infected during contact with that same twin sister.

During the course of treatment, Astesia took her sister's advice to join Rhodes Island.\nAstesia is quite skilled with a sword. Her family has passed down a form of ceremonial swordplay: a ritual in which one hand holds a celestial orb, while the other holds an originium sword. The dazzling process of advancing, retreating, parrying, and riposting with these items creates the illusion of a starry sky fading in and out of view. This unique style of swordplay combines fencing, astronomy, and originium Arts into a form usable only by those capable of mastering all three disciplines.

And yet this expression remains quite different from most originium Arts. As far as we know, the connection between astrology and originium Arts is very weak, despite most illustrious astrologers in recent years all agreeing with a level of certainty on a close link between the expression of originium Arts and the celestial bodies. At this point we still have no evidence to support a direct or indirect connection, but we speculate that the emergence of these originium Arts that appear to be linked to the celestial bodies will further convince the common people of these beliefs. Were it not for these techniques, most people would likely return to the scientific explanations for originium Arts, turning away from astrology.\nBack to Astesia, she has reported that she feels her own abilities are weakening. Our observations show that contracting Oripathy has had an effect on the originium Arts she already possessed. These effects will persist for quite some time, but we cannot say what the outcome will be, and whether it will be good or bad for Astesia. We need more time for observation and research.

You seem like you come from a well-to-do family... Why don't I help you read the stars?'\n'Astrology is a complicated subject with a long history. Father said I wouldn't be able to understand the sky's appearance if I couldn't comprehend the ancient records, let alone read it.'\n'Hahaha. Don't break your brain with all that studying, my young friend.\n'Why don't you tell me, what's the point of reading the stars if not to give people empty comfort?'\n......\n'I'd like to resolve all your doubts in my father's stead, dear reporters.'\nFrancois Urbica is surrounded by reporters. They had failed to secure the rights to interview Rhine Lab personnel, so now they turn their resentment into ridicule towards the Astrological Research Association. A quiet Liberi girl walks up to them, and Francois raises an eyebrow, but does not stop her.\n'Astrology embodies humanity's earliest interest in the sky. When the first astrology study was published, aircraft had yet to leap into our skies, and Columbia wasn't even born yet. Scholars across generations have observed the starry sky day after day, and after every Startide, they would gather and process the complex data they received, overturning conclusions. There was only one thing keeping them going: the belief that our lives were entwined with the distant stars.\n'With today's technology, we can identify many errors in their past writings, but be it from the perspective of an astrologist or a historian, their meticulous records are still an incredible achievement. Perhaps we now believe that such ancient theories should be put to rest, but the hole above Trimounts is not the truth itself—it is a door we can all peek into. As a bibliography consultant for Rhine Lab, I know well that, be it through shared experience or objective inference, Casters of astrology and scholars of astronomy have always shared the same goal. It would be unfortunate to abandon our predecessors' research. If astrology says we can never truly understand the stars, then as a scholar, I will continue our search through the scientific method. But if there comes a day when science also fails to grasp the secrets that lie outside the dome, astrology may yet offer us a new possibility.'\n......\n'Is there something on my face, Elena?'\n'Do you still remember, Sia? When we were kids, you met a famous peddler who used astrology to swindle people. He made you so mad you cried all the way home. No one could get you to stop.'\n'*sigh* Are you here to laugh at me, then?'\n'No! I just meant, if it were the you from today, you'd have been able to shut that scammer up. Just like you shut up all those reporters earlier. I used to be a bit worried you'd be stuck under Father's influence if you kept studying the stars, but now I know I have nothing to worry about—\n'You were so cool just now, Sia!'",
