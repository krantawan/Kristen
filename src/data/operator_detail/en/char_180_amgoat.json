They debated in low but excited voices over who would mentor her internship. \nThe pessimists lamented that as an Infected, no one could predict where Eyjafjalla might end up in the future.",

Her parents worked at William University, her father a graduate professor for the School of Originium, her mother an environmental and ecological research specialist. The couple died in a volcanic eruption during a survey. \nEyjafjalla's parents had begun a project to study natural Catastrophes on Terra, and the volcano was a key site. Among the files Eyjafjalla took with her to Rhodes Island, she treasured the report on that volcano most of all. She didn't want the study to end with the passing of her parents, so she decided to continue it in their stead. \nVolcanic research must be done on-site before eruption and required long-term close-range observation. Particles with Originium components tended to be common in volcanic areas, and cooling lava constantly turned over new Originium veins, making the region a breeding ground for Oripathy. This is believed to be the reason for Eyjafjalla's infection.",

Fortunately, the impairment has slowed given treatment at Rhodes Island. \nEyjafjalla typically uses a hearing aid, or asks her conversant to repeat loudly themselves in order to communicate. \nIn addition, certain facial expressions and body language have also proven effective. For example: \nShaking one's head: Unsuccessful dialogue. \nShaking one's head with a surprised expression: Very likely some words have been misunderstood and should be clarified immediately. \nNodding: Successful dialogue. \nNoding with a positive expression: Idea successfully communicated, proceed with dialogue. Still, one must be mindful of the context, since the present dialogue might be built on the pretext of a previously unnoticed misunderstanding. \nRepeating a word or sentence multiple times: Eyjafjalla is confirming what's been communicated to her, respond positively and mind one's volume. \nGlassy-eyed or negative expression: Misunderstanding has possibly occurred.

Then you should know ants love carrion. \nEven though the carrion is still rotting, the ants will still rip it to tiny chunks and carry them back to their nest to feed the whole community. \nAnts must grow stronger to survive in the world. \nDo you get it? If the carrion is Originium, we are feeding our community with it for everyone to grow stronger. And the purpose of that is to defend ourselves... and maybe oppose potential changes in the future. \nYes, according Eyjafjalla's thesis, Originium is a natural Catastrophe. \nBut we cannot stop, and will not stop. \n... \nLet the child continue her research, for now. \nBefore she can be certain of her own future. \n—Excerpt from a closed-door conference, spoken by■■",

They even make good fluffy pillows for her to lay her head on. \n[Classified Log] \nThis is not really confidential information, but something I believe is noteworthy. \nAlthough Eyjafjalla dubbed them 'little', they're still big pets. \nGiven their size, it is odd that they're hardly spotted at Rhodes Island. \nOn retrospect, it is suspicious that they only showed up to graze or when Eyjafjalla needed them. \nAnother usual phenomenon is when they give off high heat when angry or excited, possibly burning your hand when touched. \nThe truth behind all this is worth investigating.",

I am not worried at all, because I am confident that with your effort and talent, it is only a matter of time. You are my greatest pride.\nSo more than work-related things, I have something else I would write here for you.\nI know you must complain that your father and I always have so little time to be with you. Please believe me when I say this is also our greatest regret. For us, every time we look upon your peaceful, sleeping face, leaving home becomes a difficult prospect. We never know if this goodbye might be forever, and we can’t know how to say goodbye to you under such circumstances.\nKnow that this field we have given everything to is important.\nHumans are so small in the face of the vastness of the land, but we choose not to be small. It is the search for knowledge that gives meaning to our tiny lives.\nKnowledge leads humanity to surpass the limitations of what we see, pierce through soil and rock, glimpse the true face of this land, and thus tells us who we are. So even at the mouth of a volcano, beholding the abyss before me, I am thinking that we may be able to go directly to the secrets hidden in the depths of the earth.\nThis is dangerous work. I am writing these words now, to a certain extent, in order to ease my fear. I always have reasons to press on.\nBecause this is an ideal I share with your father, and I am fortunate enough to have had a family with him, and your arrival was a gift to the both of us.\nSeeing you choose to embark on the same journey as we have, we are over the moons.\nOf course, we do not see you as simply our successor, and you have no obligation to inherit our career, but we also believe that you will accomplish things far beyond what we have.\nAs a researcher, I see many qualities worth emulating in my daughter. She is meticulous, focused, tenacious, and brave. How happy I am to see this in you! I sincerely hope you continue down the path of scientific research and see your efforts bear fruit.\nYour father and I have left behind many achievements in our research, but the most precious treasure we leave to this great land is you.\nWe want to expand the boundaries of human knowledge with you.\nThat is the goal we are working toward, and you can surely stand on our shoulders to see a clearer, more beautiful world.\n\n—This letter is found in a thick pile of scientific research documents."
