Of course, the steep terrain has also slowed Kjerag's development considerably. \nThe name of the Karlan Trade Company is probably derived from the name of the holy mountain the believers of Kjerag worship. \nThe trade company, run by SilverAsh, is the only window to the outside world for the insular and conservative nation of Kjerag. At the same time, this company has unavoidably changed the country. \nIt would be wise for Rhodes Island to research SilverAsh's record, given this level of power and vision.",

LTD, is a controversial figure at Rhodes Island. \nWhatever the case, the other Operators have come to a consensus: SilverAsh is not an Operator who can be easily dispatched or controlled. \nSilverAsh and his employees work very closely with Rhodes Island, but there is no hierarchical relationship between them. \nWhether it is strategic planning or tactical command, many Operators find SilverAsh's prowess convincing. However, the more skeptical Operators familiar with political conspiracy and such machinations are wary of SilverAsh's intentions. \nAlthough SilverAsh truly cares about his younger sister, Cliffheart, who is being treated at Rhodes Island, he trusts Rhodes Island no more than Rhodes Island trusts him. \nPerhaps as the rumor says, what is really of interest to SilverAsh is the value of Rhodes Island Pharmaceuticals itself, as well as the Doctor he regards as a competent rival... \n Dr. Kal'tsit is opposed to trying to make any further contact with SilverAsh.

Despite the ruling, evidence at the scene pointed to foul play by political enemies of the Silverash clan. \nPerhaps because of the rapid decline of the Silverash Family, this matter was left unsettled. \nNaturally, the incident had a huge effect on young SilverAsh's life. But as SilverAsh was the scion of a wealthy family and not a weakling by any means, he never sank into despair, and even kept raising his two younger sisters until they were old enough to take care of themselves. \nThereafter, SilverAsh left Kjerag and headed to Victoria to receive a modern education, and let the Silverash family's political enemies divide up their legacy amongst themselves. The Tri-Clan Council was three houses in name only. \nThis state of affairs lasted until SilverAsh returned back to Kjerag. Upon his homecoming, the young master took upon himself the weighty responsibility of rebuilding his clan. \nNow according to Cliffheart's testimony, the SilverAsh who had returned was no longer the gentle and precocious youngster he used to be, who would grit his teeth and bear all that the world threw at him. \nThereafter, the Karlan Trade Company quickly rose to seize a monopoly in a large number of modern industries that had previously been banned in Kjerag. He exported goods and raw materials to other countries and imported modern industrial products. In doing so, he accumulated a vast amount of wealth in a very short time, and the success of his company restored the Silverash Family name to its position in the council. \nIn what may have been a series of plays by rival clans, SilverAsh's two younger sisters each suffered a turn of fortune that would have a huge impact on the Silverash family: Pramanix was christened a Karlan Saintess in a religious ritual, and Cliffheart was infected with Oripathy. \nRhodes Island tends to believe that these were acts of political opposition, but Cliffheart thinks that these events merely once again catalyzed SilverAsh's resolve. \nNow, no one knows what SilverAsh will do, just as no one knows the purpose behind his collaboration with Rhodes Island.",

The conflict between the Kjerag conservative faction and the reformist party have gotten more and more intense.\nOn the surface, the Karlan Trade Company is only concerned with foreign trade. However, its true owner is none other than Enciodes Silverash, head of the Silverash Family and opponent of the two conservative houses in the country's parliament.\nYou may also know him as SilverAsh, brother of Rhodes Island Operator Cliffheart.\nI am convinced that the Karlan Trade Company doesn't pay a cent to the government of Kjerag. It isn't a state-owned enterprise! Its operations and business are controlled entirely by SilverAsh himself!\nModern military equipment has passed from Raythean's hands, through the Karlan Trade Company's channels, and into Kjerag. The conservative faction doesn't even have any means of tracing the whereabouts of the goods.\nThe trade route has already been moved to the foot of the holy mountain, Karlan. The Vine-Bear Court has already used SilverAsh's sister, Saint Pramanix, as leverage to try to get the Silverash family to leave the Three House Parliament and hand over control of the valley and mining sites.\nThe troops the Karlan Trade Company sent to the training camps have already returned from Ascarat County in Victoria. Where are they now? The conservative Kjerag guards don't have any idea.\nSo what does Kjerag need most right now? We are reaching a boiling point here. What do they need?\n\nPressure from outside.\nJust a little bit of pressure from the outside. Just the tiniest little push...\nThe avalanche will bury all of Kjerag, including all of its conspiracies and all of the matters of the past.\n\nI admit that perhaps the Karlan Trade Company isn't hiding anything dangerous.\nEven so, should we really put ourselves in danger just because Cliffheart received a secret letter?\nAt the very least, Rhodes Island as a whole should not assume this magnitude of risk.\n\n--Dobermann, at the meeting 12 days before the incident at the mountain.",

He approached it with liniment and gauze in hand, applying the medicine in the bottle to the wound before bandaging it up.\nIt struggled a little at first, but was too weak to do anything but accept the boy's treatment before falling into a deep slumber.\nOn the second day, the boy took it back to where it had been found. They wandered through the woods for an entire day until the boy was exhausted and gasping for breath, but in the end found only the remains of two adult fowlbeasts. He built a small grave for them, then turned to it and said:\n'Now, both of us are in the same boat.'\nThe boy took it back to his room, and the tiny nest inside became its new home.\nThe boy would come check on it every day. He liked to gently wipe its plumage while chatting with it, unconcerned with whether it could understand him.\n......\nLike that one night, when the boy approached it with a sullen face and said:\n'I'm confident I have what it takes to be a strong clan leader or a good brother, but I cannot guarantee I can do both at once.'\nThe boy sighed as he spoke. He contemplated for a long time, before finally running off to return with a box that smelled nice. Inside was his sister's favorite dish.\n......\nLike that one afternoon, when the boy approached it with a tinge of melancholy in his voice:\n'I want to graciously wish Gnosis success on his new journey, yet I selfishly hope for him to stay.'\nPerhaps because he had been bottling it in for so long, the boy spent the next half hour explaining to it the situation of the Edelweiss clan, the difficulties facing Gnosis, and his reluctance to part ways with his best friend. In the end, he sighed again and said, 'Alas, you're the only who can hear me out. I'd better think of a farewell gift for him now.'\n......\nAnd like that day when its wounds healed, and the boy took it out to the snowy plains to practice flying. When it was about to take off, he took out a black silk scarf, tied the fabric around its neck, and asked:\n'Will you come with me?'\n—At that moment, the boy had already decided to set aside the burdens of being a clan leader and depart from the Snow Realm to study abroad.\nIt simply cocked its head and looked at him.\nOf course, it did not know what the boy was worried about, why he was anxious, or why he was sad.\nBut perhaps, it sensed that the boy, just like it, did not wish to stay confined in a warm room. He wished to soar beneath the blue sky—\nIt spread its wings and leapt forward.\nThen, to the boy's happy, surprised shouts, it took off with the wind.\nOn that day, it learned to fly once again.",
