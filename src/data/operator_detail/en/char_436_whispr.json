There was no doubt she fulfilled high standards as a Medic, with her expertise above all else being first aid in various emergency situations. Once we considered Miss Whisperain's circumstances, we sent her an invitation. Rhodes Island wouldn't restrict her staying or going, but if her own interests aligned, she could act as a provisional Medic Operator in joint with Rhodes Island's operations before she left.   \nAfter several days of hesitation, Miss Whisperain accepted our proposal.",

Her immune system requires particular attention, having reached a dangerous state. Oripathy has not infected her frail body, despite its rampant spread across this world and all its people. Yet, frail is still the only word that appropriately describes Miss Whisperain's constitution.   \nWe're not sure why Miss Whisperain doesn't choose to settle down in a city suited to her, but rather continues to walk the world's four corners, never calling a single place home for long. Regardless, while Miss Whisperain lodges for the time being at Rhodes Island, the Medical Department has suggested she be a medical worker onboard the ship, minimizing unnecessary field missions and avoiding further burden on her body.",

From the faint sorrow and vexation in the little talk she makes, and the struggle and expectation seen behind her glasslike eyes, you can tell Miss Whisperain isn't distant by nature. There's just some innate reason she has, and so she chooses to be apart from the crowd, to close herself off from others.  \nHowever, there seem to be signs of a turn for the better, in the time since she joined Rhodes Island. Though the roving doctor still avoided any involvement with others at all costs, Rhodes Island's cast of operators isn't short of warmth, and life aboard the ship always seemed to hide all kinds of 'accidents' to tie her up in... and after enough 'accidents,' we can say that our present Miss Whisperain lets much more of a rich array of moods show than the one that first joined us. And by her side, little by little, more familiar faces have started showing up.  \nThough it perplexes her and she's helpless in the face of them, one can see that Miss Whisperain doesn't sincerely reject the bubbling, lively little mishaps that happen around her.",

Her expertise in film appreciation is nigh unparalleled.  \nHer angle is nothing like a critic's, fussing and picking and passing judgment. Miss Whisperain throws herself whole into the film, learning a work's characters' emotions by firsthand experience. The sentimental roving doctor's natural heart is fine-woven and sensitive, highly empathetic towards others, and this becomes even more apparent when she's picture-watching. Miss Whisperain can often be influenced by strong emotions, writing out vivid, piercing impressions of what she watches, and these reviews have been well-received across the ship, esteemed by many movie-loving Operators as a viewer's guidebook.   \nFor each film she's seen at a regular screening, as a memoir, Miss Whisperain will hold onto the cinema ticket's stub. To the roving doctor, this act seems to hold a special kind of sense, each ticket stub representing some memory she doesn't want to forget.  \n\n[Classified Log]\nSetting aside her innate frailty, by her own disclosure, we've ascertained that Miss Whisperain falls under a very rare branch of the Ægir, possessing an extraordinary constitution. Under the effect of the race's characteristics, this type of Ægirian is exceptionally frail. When the body is incapable of enduring its environment or has been gravely wounded, it will relapse to a young stage, losing its prior memories and maturing anew.  \nAfter several examinations, the Medical Department arrived at a conclusion, and this rather strange conclusion seemed to fit with Miss Whisperain's own confessions. Her mentions of 'rejuvenation' during conversation were not truly in the sense of longevity, but referred to a biological differentiation, transformation and regression. \nIt was precisely because memory loss accompanied each of her 'deaths' that Miss Whisperain began to dread forming connections with people, scared that her own deaths and their oblivions would come to harm the people around her. For the keenly sensitive Miss Whisperain, it's hard to bear.",

We all muttered how it was some devil's witchcraft silently spreading about, and so we all kept our houses tightly shut. But we didn't have the heart to throw a single frail woman back into the wild in the rainstorm, so we agreed to let her in.\nThe first moment she laid eyes on Veitch, she sensed something was wrong. She was prudent as we worked through his symptoms with her, and she asked how the village at large was doing, before revealing herself to be a roving doctor.\n'This is no Originium Arts; it's an illness. The soil and wellwater is contaminated, and the children are the first to be sick; as the poisoning builds up over time, the adults will come to show symptoms too.'\nShe opened her suitcase, and mixed a medicine with practiced hands. As she did, she spoke. 'I'm sorry. All I can give myself is a temporary first aid, but the only way to cure an illness such as this is to be away from the contamination's source, and convalesce through medication in the long-term. If possible, I'd ask you to tell all the village that they should move away from here.'\n'But this is our home,' my husband said with worry. 'Even if this soil will harm us, where are we going to shelter if we leave here?'\nThe doctor said nothing more. She worked in simple silence.\n\nThe weather had cleared up the next day, and I found the doctor just as she was about to leave. On the door was stuck a wild flower, a kind that grew anywhere. In that instant, a faint memory of someone seemed to match with her in my head.\n'I remember you, doctor. I've met you before.'\n'I was still in a small town on the outer edge of a nomadic city. You'd make home visits to everyone, and you always secretly handed out fresh flowers to us children... I was behind the curtains watching, I remember seeing from there.'\n'That was decades ago by now. My mother caught Oripathy, see and we were driven out... and I've gone from a child to a married woman now, I know you wouldn't recognize me. But, well, you look about the same now, compared to all the way back then.'\nI told her how grateful I was for her, from the bottom of my heart, for she cured me of my fever when I was young, and now she'd saved my own child too. Yet the look on her face was at first blank, then became so sorrowful, as if she was close to weeping.\n'No, please... don't go on any further. Just treat me as though I'd never visited before.'",
