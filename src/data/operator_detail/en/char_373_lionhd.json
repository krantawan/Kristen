Yeah, we've been 'ere for a few years, and heard something a couple years back. \nWhat the 'ell's going on with Victoria these days? Us folks have been dealing with Victorians for quite some time now, so we've seen things. Since the mining rush started, we've been seeing caravans carrying some odd gadgets. A few years ago, they suddenly stopped showin' up, and we'd occasionally see people clad in common Victorian clothes collapsin' by the side of the road. Often frail-lookin' women, children, and the elderly too. Y'see, even a well-trained Messenger has to bring enough supplies, and wouldn't dare set out without a vehicle. But you look at these people who can't even get in a caravan, tryin' to cross such a vast expanse outside of any jurisdiction. Who can manage something like that? \nDidn't find out about this 'til later, but apparently one of the boys on our town's mining ship heard from somewhere that a number of years back, before the mining rush really picked up steam, a number of Victorian steam barons came by our mining towns to sign off some limited permits with the trade union. After these barons paid their dues, they extracted some ore, set up their factories when they got back, and made a small fortune. Naturally, power gathered in the hands of these people, and the industry grew bigger an' bigger. Even a few small nomadic cities got built between the route from here to Victoria. But recently, the supply of ore dried up all of a sudden and nobody knew what was goin' on. They sent a handful of prisoners who had been stripped of their rights to a site in Rim Billiton and had 'em illegally snatch up the ore there. Our union here at Rim Billiton had its hands tied for a variety of reasons, and this situation continued until the 'Cage Incident' broke out.\n—Transcript of a conversation at a mining town tavern in Rim Billiton",

Please rest assured, Victorian officials will know to hold their tongues regarding this matter. Or rather, I would infer that someone is currently pulling the strings behind the scenes to hand control of the autonomous county to Rim Billiton in the future. \nYes, and I fear that it is going all too well. The rushed implementation of the new ruling aristocrats' short-sighted policies, the exile of criminalized political opposition, leaked news regarding hostages, the negligence towards the armed forces and domestic defense, and the laissez-faire nature of the Victorian government... have all set the stage for a brewing conflict. \nAmong these cases, an executive official's handling of a political offender's family created a particularly unreasonable hostage situation. Women and children were forced into cages under dilapidated facilities and sent to work in dark mine shafts, never to see the light of day in a way that was tantamount to murder. After news of this abhorrent practice broke, public outrage was inevitable. These new aristocrats, the visionary entrepreneurs who capitalized upon Rim Billiton's mining craze, should never have allowed this to occur, let alone make such a stupid decision... unless the decision itself is part of a much larger transaction. \nRegardless, this is not a problem that can be solved by a former clerk who was reduced to a 'bandit' after being persecuted and jailed for participating in a union protest against their radical pact. But I do have some other ideas, namely about the talent referrals that your company mentioned in the past. \nPresumably your company has done some research beforehand, and it should be clear that in this incident, the kindness and enthusiasm of Rim Billiton's workers played a vital role. Though some may have their suspicions, these virtues are not eclipsed by those who had ulterior motives in mind. I do have a recommendation in fact - his professionalism may have been critical to this incident, and he is praised by many as a hero who dove 'into the cages' in a daring operation to liberate those trapped underground. However, this may not necessarily be a good thing for him. The officials who passed down these barbaric laws were not entirely snuffed out by the angry mobs in the clashes that followed, so I cannot guarantee that there are no survivors out there who still harbor a deep resentment. Although they no longer have any influence over the autonomous county, nor can they seek to ambush the steam power-equipped mining teams of Rim Billiton, it would not be impossible for them to lie in ambush in the outskirts, waiting to attack a lone Catastrophe Messenger who travels with only one bodyguard. In fact, there have been cases of such attacks over the last two years. \nAlthough we tried to persuade this individual to stay within the city and leave the data collection to others, he was even more adamant in requesting missions that would send him away from relative safety. Perhaps he is well aware of our intentions and does not want to run the risk of getting people in the city involved. But does he really have this kind of self-destructive thinking? ...I hope he has a more optimistic outlook. You see, he is the kind of person who is always ready and willing to accept new things, and is never content to languish in the same environment for too long. In any case, entrusting him to you should be the right course of action. Take him - or perhaps, accompany him - to see the vastness of Terra, and more.' \n—Transcript of a conversation at an official residence in the Autonomous County of Eureka",

He employs a simple directional shockwave, the strength of the impact roughly equivalent to that of an adult's punch.

It is worth noting that the boulder was infused with low-impurity minerals that had well-preserved structures akin to having gone through beneficiation. We speculate that this is among the reasons why he is highly sought after by mining companies. After analyzing data gathered by our equipment, we determined the Leonhardt was able to skillfully use his Arts to locate and finely separate the structure of the same kind of sand or metal within a range, accomplishing this by attacking the particles with high-speed bursts of debris.",

He has only ever seen their faces on a couple of group photos.\nWhile apparently this is not at all uncommon for children born on board Rim Billiton's mining ships, it isn't something one would consider normal, either.\n\nLike many other Cautus children, the boy is very active and tends to get into trouble every now and then.\nIt might therefore be hard for those who rarely visit the library to imagine him pouring through the books on technology his father left behind.\nThe most likely source of this habit is an erudite old man with whom he is not related, who has always kept him company and reprimanded him since he was a child.\n\nWith such an unusual guardian, the boy had some perfectly natural questions for someone in his position.\nWho were his parents? How did they die?\nThe boy does actually have a vague idea. He long ago learned from the books what the equipment and instruments his father was standing next to in the photo meant.\nThe boy is much more delicate than he appears. He is worried that perhaps the reason that no one ever mentioned his father until he broached the subject is because his father had put everyone in danger with a work accident. That they avoided the subject so he wouldn't feel guilty.\n\nThe erudite old man can see that the boy has his misgivings. However, he had promised Alisha that he'd take care of her child, that he'd never let him choose the arduous path that his father once walked. That he'd never tell her child that his father spent his last moments selflessly entering collapsed caves to rescue strangers that didn't believe him, under the guise of conducting a post-Catastrophe inspection, and that he'd keep him from thinking that his father was to blame for his mother's final days in depression.\nHowever, there was one lie that the old man cannot bring himself to tell the child. He doesn't have what it takes to tell the child that his father wasn't a hero. As the ship's former Catastrophe Messenger, the old man cannot help but take pride in the young man who found himself here after being framed in Victoria, but nevertheless dedicated himself to fighting Catastrophes.\n\n'But, Alisha... Didn't you name your child Leonhardt because you were hoping he could be like his father...?'\n\nPerhaps it is the fate of his bloodline at work, but the boy could not be dissuaded from studying to become a Catastrophe Messenger. He met friends with whom he could trust his life, and he quickly earned the recognition of many of those around him.\nThat came much later, though.",
