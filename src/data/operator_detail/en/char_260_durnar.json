She spares no effort to provide everyone with the most delicious and cheapest snacks. She cannot hope to compete with 'hidden enemies' in a battle of wits and bravery, but her original intention was merely to add some happiness to the lives of those at Rhodes Island, anyway.

When the brass had had enough of her stubbornness, they gave her a promotion, sending her to manage a squad of fresh recruits. She trained the kids, with great frustration, and they in turn changed her disposition. In time, she grew to accept the soldiers as her own. For the sake of their training, she traded her dual electric swords for the sword and shield combo she uses today. She put her heart and soul into her men, right up until the point when the brass decided to send them on a suicide mission. Dur-nar was beside herself. She flew into a rage and assaulted a suprior officer. She has been unwilling to discuss the events that followed. According to certain documents we've acquired, she was forcibly discharged. She then went through a period of hopping from security to police to mercenary work for short stints, up until she arrived at Rhodes Island. When the Doctor asked her in private why she had come to join Rhodes Island, she produced a letter. It was a letter of thanks from the few survivors of her squad of trainees. At the end of the letter, the Doctor fixated on a particular sentence, 'If there were a place where the command actually cared about the grunts, would you give it a try?' After that was an address to send her resume to Rhodes Island, along with all the names of the survivors.\n\n'And that's why I'm here.'",

Have you heard of the Springtime Offensive? Yes, that's right. THAT Springtime Offensive. Both sides were still getting ready for battle. She picked up two electric blades all by herself and went charging at a group of enemies. I've never seen someone with such an outstanding character as that. The enemy never knew what hit them. The rest of our troops followed her lead, and that was that. The enemy was finished. Yes, she's a strong one, all right. She can do anything. She's just not great at obeying discipline. She really gave those old guys a hard time. I still remember the looks on their faces at her award ceremony. It was something to behold. For a period of time, all of Columbia's recruitment materials had her and her alone on them. It's a shame that I never heard much about her after she moved units. Oh man, she's with you guys. How did you manage to recruit her? My companions have been looking for her for a long time. Even after all this time, she probably fetches a huge commission. Oh, it's time to go. Shift's up, I need to withdraw. Come by and talk more the next time you get a chance. It's a date.' \n\nSource: Excerpt of recorded conversional between personnel member D335 and Headhunter H. Jr.",
