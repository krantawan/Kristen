The constant moving, uneasy childhood and rough streets of Columbia gave rise to Vigna's unruly side. \nAs a Sarkaz, Vigna saw a lot of discrimination against people like her, and often got into scuffles standing up against it. Of course, there were Sarkaz sympathizers, but they were few and far between. \nVigna saw clearly the prejudice rooted in misunderstanding and closed-mindedness. It depressed her.

Most of the lances were left to collect dust in the storehouse. Even though Vigna had enough cash for a better weapon, she saw the lance in the corner and right off the bat knew she had to have it. \nWielding the lance requires great strength and skill, so Vigna doubled her daily training regimen. And to improve the power of the lance, she contacted the original manufacturer and custom-ordered a new model in pursuit of the perfect build. \nAfter her modifications, her lance is now a light, keen, durable, and powerful weapon. Vigna herself has also stepped up her own personal combat training in order to improve her mastery over the unique tool. \nVigna has never felt she could or would ever quit. Every practice session, every battle all gave her an important sense of improvement, and she knew she wasn't even close to her limits.",

Why?'\nVigna receives a puzzled stare in response.\n'Why am I going back to Kazdel now?'\n'Always comes a day Sarkaz head home again, right?'\n'Hahahahah, you're kidding, Vinny.'\nThe young Sarkaz stands up.\n'I'm a Columbian. My home's right here.'"
