She suddenly appeared in front of the landship on its course, with Operator Projekt Red held hostage by her side. Before the ship's defensive alarms even sounded, S.W.E.E.P. had already secured Red and subdued Crownslayer.\nWe were quick to notice the changes in Projekt Red. She was unharmed, but had a blank look on her face, as though she had sunk into some sort of delirium. Our medical operators hurried to give her a comprehensive examination, and confirmed that this was the result of drastic emotional fluctuation. From her fragmented replies, we pieced together that something happened during a personal visit to Siracusa, and we determined that her odd behavior had nothing to do with Crownslayer, who had even helped her during a suicide attempt. During the course of our examination, the subdued Crownslayer was shouting Dr. Kal'tsit's name and things such as 'Come and take care of your wolf cub already,' along with an unending tirade in both Ursine and Siracusan. As Dr. Kal'tsit was not on the ship at the time, we temporarily locked her in a cell under strict supervision while we sent an urgent communique to Dr. Kal'tsit asking how to handle her.\nA few months later, we received her reply. Surprisingly, she suggested we lift Crownslayer's confinement and allow her some measure of monitored freedom, including but not limited to access to the low security areas of the ship and the right to participate in Rhodes Island missions.\nThis was how a former Reunion member came aboard Rhodes Island using undisclosed means and became, in a sense, one of our members.\n\nThe following is only for staff with high clearance:\nIn light of Crownslayer's identity as a former member of Reunion, she is to be placed under observation by both S.W.E.E.P. and the HR department. This is to prevent her doing anything unnecessary, but also to ensure her personal safety. Though the conflict between Rhodes Island and Reunion is long over, many of our people still feel the pain of losing our comrades. Even if she does not have their blood on her hands, anger cannot be controlled once it boils over. We will keep her under surveillance until she truly becomes one of us.\nWe have entrusted Operator Mudrock with this task. Considering their shared backgrounds as former Reunion members, this will hopefully help us better evaluate how Crownslayer is doing aboard Rhodes Island.",

Didn't those thugs use those in Chernobog and Lungmen? Do they have an inside man in Logistics? That's real sly of them, hiding weapons in the cafeteria! Are they about to raise Reunion's flag again aboard Rhodes—N-No way!'\n'They closed the kitchen doors and pulled down the curtains, I can't get a read on the inside. This is an emergency, no time to report to the higher-ups, and no time to look for a floor plan. Gonna head in first to keep things under control!'\n'Those thugs are... having a culinary club meeting around the table? Some are busy by the stoves and ovens. There's a redhead kneading some dough who noticed me real quick. She stopped her kneading and cut me a slice of pizza, fresh out the oven, even though I'm holding a weapon. I think she knows me, but I'm pretty sure I've never seen her before.'\n'The operators behind me stowed their weapons, and they all got a slice too. It was good pizza. Instead of the usual sausage, it's got Ursus-style salted meat. Since it's right out the oven, the heat's just right, and the bread's got just the right amount of chew. I gobbled up my slice real quick. The red-headed lady has been all over the kitchen: kneading, chopping the meat, pouring the sauce, keeping an eye on the pizzas in the oven and occasionally dealing with people trying to rush her. She seems really into it. People are calling her Lyudmila. Kind of a pretty name, Lyudmila... Wait, Lyudmila?!'\n—Excerpts from a monitor's real-time voice logs\n\n'I asked Lyudmila why she was staying aboard Rhodes Island, and she told me she was waiting for that hag Dr. Kal'tsit to come back. Her words, not mine. She wanted to ask her if she knew about her master when she was sent to live with her uncle. If she knew about the wolf pack's game. If she did, why didn't she do anything about it? If she didn't, and things were always out of her control, then why did she always act so sure of herself? In short, she is ready to give Dr. Kal'tsit a verbal beatdown in front of everyone.\n'Look past her sharp tongue for a moment. Lyudmila wants answers out of Dr. Kal'tsit, but... she's gotten used to waiting here. I've seen her buying magazines from the store, killing time in the Convalescent Garden... doodling on the bridge with charcoal. Maybe life here is a rare chance for her to relax. It's not hard to understand. When I first got here, people were saying a Reunion hammer-wielder had infiltrated the landship... but all I was thinking about was that I finally had a place I could, err, go for a light stroll.'\n—Excerpt from a recorded conversation between HR and Mudrock",

This was the third time Lyudmila was going to Siracusa.\nThe first was when she was still seven. Kal'tsit had entrusted someone to take her there, to her uncle. It seems even the all-knowing Kal'tsit can still be blindsided by unexpected factors, no matter how well-thought-out her choices are.\nThe second was when she split from Reunion, leading a band of brothers and sisters who didn't want to follow Nine to Victoria. Over the course of two years, Lyudmila saw them back to their hometowns, one by one. For those with no home to go back to, she found them work. Finally, she walked back to her master's house in Siracusa, as though it were all one big farewell ceremony. But what came after was hardly an ending deserving of such ceremony.\nReunion, the Truckers' Union, Ursus, Siracusa... None of them were places associated with pleasant memories to her, but when the Field Operators Department was discussing who to entrust this mission to, there were eyes that fell on her. She doesn't know why she didn't refuse.\n\n[Field Mission Voice Log 05]\n'This would be easy to settle if you just took out a few famiglia dons—problem solved. Fine, fine, I know that's not how you do things.'\nThe negotiating operator was murdered in broad daylight, and so the cooperation between Rhodes Island and one of the local famiglie was all for naught. The other famiglie were very satisfied with this state of affairs, and their alliance of convenience broke down back into their usual territorial selves. About a week later, the canceled press conference went ahead as scheduled, to the surprise of many. That dead negotiating operator was on TV, declaring that Rhodes Island had managed to reach an agreement with their partner famiglia, and that the supplies included in the deal had already been transferred. Only now did the other famiglie realize that it was all a trick, and that they had been scammed.\n'—If they're out for blood, then we'll just have to do it ourselves before they get a chance. A killer without a target's not going to swing their knives around for no reason. Here, I'll show you. See? If I stab you with this collapsible knife, then the fake blood will—Ow, some got in my eye... Give me a sec. The bathroom's that way, yeah...?'\n\n[Field Mission Voice Log 09]\n'...I've run into a personal matter I gotta deal with.'\nA truck driver on the streets of Trieste had noticed Lyudmila and called out her, trying to drag her back to Nuova Volsinii with him. He yammered on in excitement about how the drivers didn't want to move camp, and how City Hall was preparing to build the resettlement area in their camp. Eirene had brought Sommer's daughter to the new city too. Her condition is stable, and she's about to go to school... The chance reunion only ended after he forced Lyudmila into drinking three cans of salt soda.\nShe couldn't deny her own happiness right then. There's no doubt that Eirene, as head of the union, was able to grasp something during Carnevale that could change her fate. Change countless people's fates. The changes in her were clear, but the Truckers' Union never deviated from its original goal: to give the drivers better lives. She had a sudden recollection of the day she joined Reunion. The Infected were kicking about some nobles in the snow, gathering around the bonfires while eating meat and potato stew, even dreaming about how one day, they would demand an explanation from the Emperor himself, and let everyone on this great land breath freely for once. The Truckers' Union couldn't hold a candle to Reunion, but to her, they really were more alike than not: they both appeared along her path to vengeance, and thanks to some bitter experiences and some rather absurd changes, she chose to leave them both. It seems she has managed to make one big loop in life before learning something about herself: she is someone easily waylaid by hate. She should keep an eye on the one in the lead, while not completely denying the fact that her past comrades had, for a time, given her a reason to live, given her faith and flame.\n\n[Field Mission Voice Log 11]\n'Mission complete, heading back to the landship soon.'",

For the sake of the institute's safety, we must be prepared. Our government contacts have begun their work, and I pray they will have good news for us. At the same time, we must send away our families, seal off the sarcophagus, copy or destroy our data... There's simply too much to do, and I may not have time to see Lyuda. If you do see her, please give her a kiss on the cheek for me.\nEver since Sophina passed away, Lyuda's hate for Chernobog has grown by the day. Staying here will only cause her to suffer more. As her closest family, I should be with her right now. But I am a selfish man. Our progress at the institute has reached a rate where I do not wish to take even a single day off to go home, slice some bread, and make breakfast for her. I truly wish I was the type of person who could give up everything in the name of science, but I love my little Lyuda so. It torments me, and makes me tarry when I should be sending her off somewhere more suited for her.\nBut now, Ursus has made my decision for me.\nNo matter if we survive this oncoming calamity or not, Director Kal'tsit, I ask you send Lyuda to Siracusa. Sophina's elder brother has an estate in a small town there, and when she was still alive, he once offered us shelter. I believe having Lyuda live there for a while is the most suitable choice. She can complete her studies in a foreign land, open herself up to the arts and sciences, become the sort of person she wants to be—a navigator who charts the course of scientific research, or a politician striving for the well-being of all.\n...\nI hope you can leave the city without any trouble, and that our research will see fruition soon, realizing both our plans and yours.\nYours, Ilia.\n\nAs the surveillance team rushed over to the landship's middle layer to turn off the alarm, Crownslayer slipped out of Dr. Kal'tsit's office. She held in her hand a letter as she waited for the team to come and subdue her. It was just like the first time she stepped aboard Rhodes Island, except she was calmer this time around.\n'It's obvious that I'm not going to be a navigator or politician anymore, Papa.\n'Tell Kal'tsit that when she gets back to the landship, I need to be the first to see her. She needs to tell me all the reasons why that research institute was set up, about the research itself, everything about her own history... All of Ursus's secrets. All of them.'",

      "desc": "'This painting is the most famed of Valentin's works, purchased on recommendation some years ago. Parted with about a million chervontsy for it,' Duke Propp effusively tells the Government Inspector as he introduces his collection.\n'And here we have a precious night pearl recovered from the east mountains. Only two in the entire empire, one of them here with me, the other in the hands of Duke Beria...'\n'You mean this one?' The Inspector pulls a gemstone out of her pocket the size of a burdenbeast's eyeball, glowing in faint green.\n'Well, good Inspector, you certainly know your treasuries!', lauds the Duke, loath as he is to. His territory is tenth on the Inspector's rounds, and the first nine are all extravagant when it comes time for bribes. Not one Inspector hasn't been thoroughly spoiled by the time they make it here.\nThe Inspector strolls up to a corner of the collection, and picks up an altogether unremarkable and antiquated military saber, toying with it amusedly in her hands. Its edge is polished to a shine, reflecting her carmine eyes.\n'What fine taste you have!' As if he's caught sight of prey in his trap, the Duke bustles over to ingratiate himself. 'This precious sword here was one bestowed by the previous Tsar. A perfect spoil for you to take back to Deity Grypherburg, I might think.'\n'How could I repay your generosity for such a precious article, Duke?', the Inspector makes her second question.\n'I simply ask that on your return to Grypherburg, you might recount my service to His Majesty, so I could take part at the capital when he grants his subjects...'\n'So you're telling me, you want the Empire to know of your mines' service, ten years accident-free, accomplished by having everyone who knew of the disaster there buried in a collapsed shaft?'\nThe Inspector's words completely blindside the Duke, and the sycophantic smile freezes on his face.\n'You want the Empire to know of the 'ten thousand bandits' you killed, when half of them were refugees starving to death in your territory?'\nThe color in the Duke's face goes from pale to ghastly. He has never met an Inspector like this before.\n'Or maybe, you want the Empire to know that you, and the past nine Dukes, were all such devout and loyal executioners?' The Government Inspector, with the ceremonial saber at hand, has cast the night pearl worth a king's ransom straight aside. She pulls off her hood, revealing her fiery red hair. The Duke meets her eyes, and they call to mind the recent rumor—only a few years ago, the Crownslayer, whoever she was, had returned to Ursus.\n'It couldn't be. Are they all...' The Duke tries to ask, but can only swallow the rest of his sentence, along with his fear.\n'If there was an Inspector visiting, and if the Empire did know of all your deeds, maybe they would've given you shiny new prizes for it.'\nDuke Propp is dying to run, to scream for help, but before he knows it, thick and choking smoke coiling about him has stolen his voice.\n'It's a real shame the Empire can't hear your cries.' The 'Inspector' raises the saber.\n'But don't worry. The Crownslayer will grant you your reward.'",
