Multiple instructors have expressed their surprise at the intensity of her training. Instructor Dur-nar is concerned that she may be overworking herself to a dangerous level, but Saileach insists on maintaining this level of intensity, and consultation with the Medical Department along with their comprehensive assessment of Vouivre physical fitness has allowed it to continue for the time being. \nMultiple consecutive tests have shown rapid improvement in Saileach's combat ability.

I spent an age poring through reference material—I hope I haven't spelt anything wrong.'\nHer choice of spelling originates from an ancient language called Taran, and not the present-day Victorian she knows. Profile data shows that Saileach was born in a lakeside city to Victoria's south, completely unconnected to the area of Tara. Her own knowledge of Taran originates entirely from a friend local to County Hillock. Saileach tells us that in the region of Tara, on the spring festival each year, the people would take freshly budded willow branches to adorn the streets and statues. Every year she served at County Hillock, she would accompany this very friend to the agricultural plates on the outskirts, picking the best branches for the occasion, in the end completing this rather commemorative affair. Though Saileach hasn't spoken on where this friend presently is, judging by written records in reports on the County Hillock incident, the city was reduced to ruins in the fighting; it is exceedingly possible her close friend met with misfortune.\nSaileach's experiences in County Hillock have no doubt changed her outlook. The urgency she's shown in improving her own combat ability likely stems from her regret in being unable to prevent that tragedy. Good thing she did not sink into grief, let alone take to a path of revenge, but has transformed herself and taken the impetus to move forward. After all, in Saileach's choice of codename there lies the hope that County Hillock may rise from the ashes anew.",

The attackers wore plain clothes, but we could tell they were Dublinn. The vehicle and comms equipment were destroyed, Fred and I were injured, while Shredder nearly lost his life. It was Janie who stubbornly pulled us one by one out from the scrap, trekked to the trade route to flag down a caravan, and talked them into lending us a truck—saving all our lives.\nThe entire way, the sick one didn't come to. What was strange was after that attack, the enemy didn't chase us further, either. It was like they just wanted to find out if she was really with us, and then they tried us to see how much strength we really had. I thought we were done for when we were trapped under those seats. I mean, they killed Outcast, the Lass! Even if the few of us threw it all away then and there, could we do ten percent of what she could?\n......\nFinally, I want to recommend Janie—and I mean that Miss Jane Willow, who came with us back to the ship, should formally join Rhodes Island. I've known her willingness for a while now, since we left. Originally, it was Outcast most fit to recommend her—so with... a graver sorrow than all I know, I tell you all this in her stead. Together with us, Miss Willow has saved countless people in County Hillock, and she will have the opportunity in future to save countless more.

From the moment she decided to leave the army, she never again held herself to be a Victorian soldier. In truth, she took to her new identity as a Rhodes Island Operator exceptionally well, and very quickly was proactive in throwing herself into all manner of combat/non-combat missions. She more than once mentioned the deceased elite operator Outcast's influence on her. Returning to Victoria, to her, is more of a calling. She holds a sense of justice deep in her heart, firmly resolved to spare no effort, looking to stand off against the evils that brought her such bitter memories.\nVery soon, once learning she also came to Rhodes Island, Saileach's first order of business was to find Bagpipe. The two of them had a discussion that lasted through the night, and by the next day, Saileach applied for short-term landship leave. She understands that the time to return has almost come.\n\n'From the County Hillock incident, we see that the Taran situation has already climbed to a tipping point. If their leader is not Draco, then the eruption of conflict may be deferred by a decade, but the situation in whole will not have changed.\nVictoria's centuries-old policies targeted at Tarans have made inevitable the present fires of war. Yet when we look back at history, after they were forced to split half of their authority with the Aslans, the Draco royal family, original rulers of the whole of Victoria, surely could not indulge another of their race peaceably governing a third of the country's territory. In the same manner, nor would the aristocracy—who begrudgingly shared their take with the new nobility—let the opportunity pass to press down on the area's indigenous peoples, so as to make up for losses.\nI don't at all believe that this will be a localized conflict. I can only say that this war may perhaps transform the nation of Victoria. Concerning if all this will grant us any advantage in our coming Londinium operations? Don't forget: I'm just an instructor supplementing you all with a little history.'\n——Recording of Hypatia answering questions after a history lecture",

'Chocolate! I want chocolate.'\n'It's New Year's today—I'll buy you two scoops. You can pick another flavor too.'\n'Chocolate. I want chocolate for both.'\n'Brilliant. Your wish is my command, my little pea.'\n'You're the best, Da!'\n'Don't run anywhere, now.'\nShe watches her father squeeze through the crowded park and disappear into the throng. When he does, she pulls her gaze away, and begins to stare at her feet and count. Count until her father comes back.\n'One, two, three...'\nThe powerful beating of a drum interrupts the girl's mumbling. She looks up and sees the little theater across from her pull its curtains wide open, its host gaily thumping away at a hand drum.\n'One, two, three! Ding-ding-ding, it's time for the puppet show! Gather around, little mateys, you won't want to miss this! Today we've got the Song of the Shepherd Boy.'\nDrawn by the adorable puppets, the girl can't help but approach the stage—though perhaps a wide-open wooden box would be a better description.\n'Come January, King took up his greatest cane, come February, General waved saber just the same,\n'Come March, riverbank burned with hardy flame, come April not a meadow to a sprout could claim,\n'Come May, shepherd hugged his hornbeasts tame, and swore they'd find new home, far away...'\nThe puppet hugs its shaggy hornbeast, seeming hurt beyond measure, and the girl can't help but grip tight at the cloth of her skirt. Behind the stage, the host continues to sing the song.\n'Come August he forded through rapids clear, and 'hind him brayed his herd so dear,\n'Unto drear September awaited forest grim, and shaking hornbeasts shook heads at him,\n'Unto high October, a rest at mountain's foot, his beasts flock'd 'round him at center put,\n'Unto cool November...'\nBefore the host sings the next line, a large hand drags the girl out of the audience.\n'Janie! Janie! What are you over here for? Why didn't you wait where I told you to?'\n'I... I saw there was a puppet show. It was really good.\n'Do you know, I came back to an empty bench and was scared half to death.'\n'I'm sorry, Da, I... I shouldn't have gone off.'\n'Come on, now. We'd better get home.'\n'I want to watch it more, Da, at least...' The rest of her sentence is gulped back down. She glances at the puppet and his hornbeast hugging each other tightly on stage, and the backdrop is a verdant spring. She lets out a sigh of relief, and leads her father by the hand.\n'Come on, Da, let's go home too.'\n'Ahah, shepherd boy found his hornbeast a new home, then. Yet another happily ever after. Here, your ice cream.'\n'Thank you.' The girl licks at her double scoop. 'Is it bad that it's happily ever after, Da?'\n'Not particularly, Janie, there's just a lot of them. Might say we're sick of it.'\n'Really? But even if they show them over and over, I think there's not a lot of happy endings anyway...' She takes another lick.",
