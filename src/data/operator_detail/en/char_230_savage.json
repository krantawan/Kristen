I'll bring the leftover ones back, Mum, and then you can make carrot pie!'\nMum leaps up and gives Savage a few raps on the head. 'These are for you to rest up at home, and let your health come back to you!\n'Ever since you came back from that abandoned mine all a muddle, it's like your motor's never stopped.\n'If you're not banging on about how you met a ghost, then you're trying to run out of doors... Stuffing all our family plans, that's you. You've got me at wit's end.'\nShe can't possibly explain to her mother that that wasn't a ghost sighting, but on the other hand, it is true the mysterious stranger with the little rabbit hasn't left a trace for her to find.\nIt's as if whoever they were, they never existed in these lands at all.\nHow?\n'You went somewhere, suddenly passed out, then the people who were with you all vanished into thin air.\n'Ghost stories like that are a penny a piece for the workers here. That's just life in the mines.'\n'They were NOT just ghosts haunting Rim Billy!'\nEven though it was the briefest of encounters, Savage remembers the warmth of the girl curled up sleeping in her arms that evening. Moreover, when she spent every bit of her strength smashing apart boulders to rescue them from that collapsed mineshaft, the mysterious stranger clearly bled.\nThey never told her where their journey's destination lay, but when the mysterious stranger was alone, tightly wrapped in solemn silence, Savage knows she caught a glimpse of them gazing into the starry sky, and to lands far away.\nWho could be waiting for them up ahead?\nSavage doesn't know, but they need her help.\n'Mum, I'm not going to make it! I still have to go to the maintenance crew and check if they've fixed my hammer yet!'\nHer mother knows this passionate girl of hers. Ever since she was little, once she got fixated on something, she'd never let it go.\n'Oi, you forgot to empty the letterbox again, it's been more than a week now. Honestly, you make me doubt if you can take care of yourself...'\nBut that letter Savage had ignored for days is what finally calms her down. Stuffed inside is a design, drawn by hand, for a weapon just for her—and in the corner is a doodle of three people. Plus, a note.\n'Miss, pardon us for not saying goodbye. The Doctor is very sorry that you broke your weapon to help us.'\nPutting the letter away, Savage lets out a deep breath. She absolutely can't wait to hit the road again.\nA strong gut feeling tells her that in the end, they'll meet once again, and finish their journey.",
