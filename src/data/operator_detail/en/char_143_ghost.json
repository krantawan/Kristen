They pricked an ever-so-cautious drop of blood from her finger, then left her alone to recite prayer from her heart, liturgical meanings discerned by none. They tend to her body, attempt to heal her rended ego—they would not bestow her such a vile gift as this.\nShe touches the candlelight, but the fingertip feels no hint of warmth. A momentary lucidity and tranquility race ashore like foam. The edges of the waves wash over her throat cut wide open, and zealotry, scorched sun-dry in darkness, extinguishes its bellows. In the same moment, white flame climbs her wrist, sets her nun's habit alight, and leaps from her shoulder to sink into her sweeping hair.\nThrough the candlelight, she looks within. Laurentina stands before a statue. The Stygian sea encases a dome teeming with lights. The figure freed from raw stone lingers in her eyes, and its shadow chisels out an alcove. There, Laurentina lifts a machine to cut stone, a 'Little Handy' roving in circles beside her, swallowing up the fragments that pitter-patter against the floor.\nThrough the candlelight, she looks within. Rallying cries. Piercing whistles and sawblades all around as far as the eye can see, gristle and blood peeled from body, bones met together and fractured apart. The hunters born beneath domes are tearing apart the barriers of flesh now before them, their enemies falling to the seafloor as raindrops to the surface. A lance severs open a cavity; an incisive and clarion order; amidst ocean's currents Laurentina charges in. She hears singing.\nThrough the candlelight, she looks within. The statue behind the candle holder is virgin holy white, and when it weeps, it casts a shadow. She is sliced apart, to then be mended; sliced apart again, to then be mended again. Finally, they use Specter to slice apart Laurentina, and allow the seeds of dry land to root within her body. Thus, the sister kneels before the candle holder, grips her pendant tight, recites prayer from her heart, liturgical meanings discerned by none.\nThrough the candlelight, she looks within. The door to the treatment ward is pulled open. A familiar scent. A lithe yet firm echo of footsteps strikes down the candle holder, melting it into the lights of the corridor. Specter curls up, dreaming a peaceful dream so rare for her. In her dream, she burns atop the candle holder, as if she is its fourth flame."
