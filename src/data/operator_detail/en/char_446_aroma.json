As such, once onboard, it wasn't long before she was assigned as Logistics's new cleaner.\nShe has her own set of standards in determining whether the environment is considered clean enough. Her minimum requirements are that there are no lingering stenches or any chance for insects to breed. As such, she will always take care of any rotting waste on the same day, work with Engineering to deal with any waterway odors as soon as possible, and even clean an entire room simply because a rug inside was left untreated after being stained by milk.\nFind the source of the odor, clean up the stains, let the area dry and ventilate, and finally spray it with a suitably aromatic fragrance. Even operators who've never taken cleaning seriously have Aroma's workflow completely memorized.

            "storyText": "'Remember to wash your hands before a handshake!' This is recurring advice in the health handbook Aroma designed for the sickbay's juvenile patients.\nIt was her first job after she was formally appointed as cleaner. She personally volunteered to create this easy-to-understand yet detailed handbook with illustrations showing how to correctly wash hands. In her eyes, 'cleaning,' 'sanitization,' and 'health' form a direct causal chain. The smallest cleaning tasks each of us are responsible for are meant to create a sanitary environment that will ensure our health.\nOur understanding is that the reason she holds cleaning and sanitization in such high regard has to do with her childhood. According to Aroma, her grandmother—the matriarch of the family—has always stressed the importance of cleanliness. Due to how much rain Siracusa gets, mud and wastewater tend to accumulate on the roads, and her grandmother always personally enforced the rule that they must not bring such dirty things into the home. So every time she returned home, her grandmother would wipe down her shoes and place them on the veranda along with the umbrellas to dry. She would also spray the door with fragrance, leaving it all with a faint lemon scent.\n'I was really playful when I was a child. I often got home completely covered in dirt and mud... Hehe. So I always got scolded by my nonna.' Aroma sometimes speaks of her childhood, and from what little we know, it is rather hard to believe that the mischievous mud-covered girl from her stories and the quiet girl in front of us have anything to do with one another. These days, she is also particularly strict with her appearance: her collar must be clean and tidy, her sleeves must have no stains whatsoever, and the fragrance she uses must be relaxing to others. She is calm, gentle, attentive, kind, and unostentatious. She treats her tasks like a mature adult, and makes an effort to show her ideal self to those around her.\nThat said, an operator who helps in the kitchen once told us about something he witnessed. He had just gotten off his shift and returned to the rear kitchen for his clothes, only to hear singing from the kitchen, which should have been closed for cleaning. He snuck a peek through the door and found all the pots and dishes lifted up by bubbles and hovering midair. In the center of this secret stage was Aroma, who was humming and playing with the bubbles she made with her bubbling tool.\nIt pleases us to see that she gives herself these moments to unwind, despite how strict she is with herself when it comes to keeping a tidy appearance.",

But while her Arts may seem gentle by comparison, they nonetheless pack a powerful punch in their own right. These bubbles have excellent plasticity, and do not easily pop when used with her Arts.

An operator once jokingly asked her, upon seeing how engrossed she was with it.\n'The rain that falls here on Rhodes Island has no taste. In Columbia, it has the taste of the wasteland sand, and the aroma of grass when the plants are sprouting. In Siracusa, it has a faint lemon scent, the smell of tobacco, and the sour odor of sweat. And then...' Aroma stopped there. After some time, she kept gazing out the window at the intermittent rain.\nIn Siracusa, each family has their own dirty business they need dealt with, and once that's done, they are left with a mess they need a professional <i>cleaner</i> to get rid of. So thoroughly it will be as if it was all washed away by the rain. We understand Aroma's grandmother to have been one such famous cleaner. According to rumor, no matter how terrible the scene, she was able to make the place look spotless.\nAs a child, Aroma was energetic and mischievous, and she often followed her grandmother everywhere. Yet when she followed her to a cleaning job one time and broke her promise to remain outside the house—instead chasing a bubble that flew far, far away into a small alley—she witnessed a crime. Ever since, her personality shifted from lively and energetic to quiet and cautious, and she became less and less able to tolerate dirty environments. This experience also prompted her family to make the decision to move away from Siracusa and restart their business in Columbia.\nAroma tells us that, aside from that one experience, her impression during childhood was that she belonged to a normal Siracusan family who ran a laundromat as well as a workshop producing fragrances and detergents. Her strict grandmother always took charge of both family and business matters down to the last detail, and everyone else needed only follow her instructions and 'work for the family' as per Siracusan tradition.\nFor example, on holidays her grandmother would wake everyone up early to prepare. Once they were finished with the all-important house cleaning, they would follow her orders and divide up the house chores. Some would go out shopping, others would be in charge of food prep, and yet others would put up decorations in every corner of the house. Even after leaving Siracusa, this tradition remained with them year after year.\n'For as long as I can remember, it's always been pretty noisy back home, and it got even noisier during family gatherings. We could probably tear the house down just from the noise. But whenever that happened, Nonna would clap her hands, and everyone would quiet down to listen to our matriarch's orders.\n'But really, my nonna isn't as strict or scary as you'd think. She's such a kind old lady, cute even. One time when I was a kid, it rained really hard. The water in the yard almost reached up to my knees. I was so excited I rushed out to dance around and stomp on the water.\n'...Not only did she not scold me, she came out and started singing and dancing along with me. She even yelled at the others to come join us!\n'Forgiveness, trust, intimacy, and loyalty... I think that's what my family has always stood for.'",

But the wind blowing through the window brings with it a soothing lemon scent. Upon catching it, she stretches out her head and opens her eyes.\nShe sees fever medication and half a glass of water atop her bedstand, and her grandmother sitting beside her, alongside a few others anxiously staring at her. In a daze, she is propped up by her grandmother, while the others take turns checking the thermometer. Soon after, the air no longer feels so stuffy, and the room returns to its usual levity.\nHer grandmother tells her she had a fever, and that she slept for several days. The aroma of oat porridge stirs her appetite, and the brightly-colored cherry tomatoes dotting the bowl are pretty enough that one could hardly look away. Nonetheless, the subtle lemon fragrance entices her to gaze out the window. She sees clothes drying and waving in the wind, while the lemon trees in the garden send her their greetings. Just like every other windy morning.\nThe girl's head clears a bit more, yet she feels like some of her memories have gotten fuzzy.\nA few days later, she apprehensively asks her grandmother for help remembering, but she only comforts her, saying they were just fever dreams.\nHer grandmother hadn't put away her bubble wand, and she never emptied her bottle of soapy water. She had merely called a big gathering to discuss the family leaving Siracusa, and what they needed to prepare for their move to Columbia.\nBut that was no fever dream. It happened, and the girl had seen it with her own eyes.\nShe thinks of the bubbles she chased that day. Of her grandmother working on the street corner. Of how, despite being a rainless day, the streets were wet, with water slowly flowing towards the drains. Of how the mixture of reeking blood, smoke, and sweat attracted all sorts of bugs to its surface.\n...Many years later, that vivid scene still remains in her memory. Luckily, Aroma remembers what her grandmother often said:\n'Since you can't get rid of the horrible smells, best open up the window and let them all out!\n'In the end, only the fragrances that always follow us will be left.'\nIn the parcel sent by her grandmother, Aroma sees a glass bottle from her childhood. She removes the cork, dips her bubble wand into the soapy water, then slowly, gently, blows a bubble.\nShe smells it. It still is, and always will be, lemon-scented.",
