We've even heard reports of him helping inspect electrical wiring till late at night, whereupon he ended up passing out due to hypoglycemia from not even taking the time to eat. But having seen how industrious he always is, we found it difficult to speak up and dampen his enthusiasm. Though he himself felt guilty about this, he was likely to repeat the same mistake and exhaust himself again.\n'We need a turning point,' Mechanist suddenly proclaimed, as he finished reading a large-scale inspection report. Then, on another exceptionally normal day, we all heard that Mechanist suddenly took on a new apprentice. While this is nothing unusual, it's not all that common either, given how strenuous the elite operators' missions are.\nMechanist simply dismissed it as a natural turn of events, though. Eh, apprentices. Nothing is more important than having a decent goal and a thirst for knowledge, isn't that right? As it turns out, helping others channel their energy properly and sorting out mechanical wiring structures may not actually be all that different.\nOf course, ever since then, the Medical and Engineering Departments have received a lot less of the aforementioned complaints regarding Greyy.",

Ordinarily, this wouldn't necessarily be a bad thing. But it's a different story when we're talking about an Oripathy patient with a weaker physical constitution than a healthy person. Of course, the Medical Department monitors his work and rest to prevent it from getting too unreasonable, but what we are actually more concerned about is his mental health.\nHR even asked us to confirm this, but tests don't lie. Contrary to our assumptions, Operator Greyy does not have survivor syndrome or any similar disorders. We must admit we were probably a little too narrow-minded. The driving force behind his diligence is not trauma, or even a wish to repay Rhodes Island's kindness. Rather, he is genuinely interested in these technologies, and truly wants to use them to improve people's lives.\nWe often picture 'technology improving our lives' in terms of the conveniences brought by technological advancement, but it's easy to forget a key part of this picture: the men and women who work tirelessly to <i>implement</i> the technology that improves our lives. This goes for both medical and engineering tech. At Rhodes Island, we strive to provide operators like Greyy a platform where they can excel and flourish.",

In the history of its taming, the most exciting achievement ever made was undoubtedly the technology to generate electricity with it. This breakthrough single-handedly solved the problem of the high cost of Originium Arts conductors and accelerated the economization of Originium energy, while also improving its safety and ease of use.\nThanks to this technology, a wide range of products that require a stable supply of Originium energy have become available on the market. These include lighting equipment that has no risk of explosion and no need for high maintenance costs, something that we now take for granted. The unearthing of Originium energy had an explosive impact on Terra, and it was this technology that turned that impact into a trickling stream that continues to enrich each and every nomadic city.\n—From the preface of <i>Nomadic City Technologies Discussions, Volume 3</i>",

Moreover, there are also reports suggesting that the prototype of a certain piece of technology once stolen from the company was discovered in Bolívar. How it got there is currently being investigated. Based on the scattered clues we currently possess though, we have reason to believe that the prototype was undoubtedly related to a new form of energy technology. Technological innovation brings more than just good, and to sustain its birth there are always sacrifices not known to the masses. We risk being traced ourselves if we investigate any further, and as such, may have to put this matter on pause for the time being.\nIn addition, we have reason to believe that Greyy's father was arrested during the unrest and disappeared without a trace soon thereafter. The chances that he survived are slim. It is recommended that HR use their discretion in determining whether the operator should be informed of this.",

But what's even more depressing is that, from a bystander's point of view, the way he looks when he's depressed is almost comical. Or perhaps it's because it's not easy for anyone to relate to what he's feeling.\nCome to think of it, on a mission related to Rhine Lab not too long ago, he saw a kind of substance that existed only in imagination, although that's hardly unexpected in a place like that.\nRight, it may not exactly be beyond imagination. Originium Arts and conductors have for a long time allowed us to bring our wildest dreams to life, but if someone were to tell you that someone actually created something that'd previously been only a pipe dream...\nRight, it'd make you feel a little left out. That it was a little unfair. And, of course, maybe a little... jealous?\nFerdinand was telling the truth, though. Of course, such a magnificent Arts conductor like that, like something out of science fiction, could herald the start of a new era. What's more, its purpose was clearly more than just a conductor. Naturally, every engineer who admires cutting-edge technology wouldn't be able to control their eagerness to try it out.\nFortunately, having seen that transmitter at its fullest potential, Greyy knows how Mechanist feels.

Such caution reminded him of growing up in his shanty, where his mother would use salvaged materials to work a bit of Arts, igniting a small spark of light in their dark home after the sun had set, allowing him to read for a while in its glow. Then the fuel burned out, erupting in pungent smoke and dazzling sparks, spurring a moment of tremendous brightness before plunging them into darkness again.\nHe was now quite familiar with this pitch-black wilderness, devoid of light and any other people besides himself. Dim fireflies couldn't illuminate even a couple of steps ahead, leaving only the whooshing of the wind, and sometimes not even that.\nGreyy set up his framework, input data, racked the equipment on the frame, and started it running. He wasn't entirely sure what this thing could bring about, just a string of data he had calculated a few days ago; he was doing his best to bring it to life, hoping for some results. Maybe it could provide stable power to a village, perhaps it could fill in a missing piece of a technical puzzle, or maybe it would amount to nothing more than a dazzling but useless spark.\nHe was no longer afraid of the darkness, but he still grew tense, fearing that he might not even produce a spark this time.\n'Don't be scared, boy. I work at the poor house, I've seen too many dying people surrounded by loved ones. In times like those, all emotions mean something, just don't be afraid, fear doesn't help.'\nThe device flickered to life, disturbing the fireflies, causing them to flutter and fly farther into the wilderness, where they were quickly swallowed by the darkness.\nThe light illuminated the night, but it quickly dissipated within the dark, not even managing to burst into a spark.\n'Another failure...'\nGreyy slumped to the ground in despair. The wind blew across the wilderness. He didn't feel cold, only the sensation of his mother embracing him.\nHe closed his eyes, and in the far distance, the generator in the village suddenly spun into action, the entire settlement flickering to life. Yet in this quiet night, no one saw it, including Greyy, who had finally fallen into a deep sleep.\nInside, Mechanist's light suddenly intensified. He looked out the window, and a star in the sky blinked at him, a brilliant white light shining on the wastelands, as if an eternal star had finally touched the ground.\nMechanist closed the book he had been reading and walked out.\n'You can be scared, boy, but don't stop!'"
