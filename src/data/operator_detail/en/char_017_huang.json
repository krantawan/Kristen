Then you bring them together, and squeeze the air out from between them. That's pretty much what I do.'\nBlaze generally uses language like this when describing her Originium Arts, which may make it easier to understand the nature of her abilities, but tells very little to those who are trying to research and classify Originium Arts.\nOperator Blaze's Originium Arts can best be understood as the ability to rapidly heat gases within a specified area, though there obviously is a limit to how high she can raise this temperature, which she describes as 'approximately super-hot degrees.'\nShe cannot directly act upon objects, cannot exceed a certain range, and sometimes is unable to even cause direct damage. Her Arts is very restrictive in terms of the types of materials and receptors that can be acted upon. \nNevertheless, through continuous testing and training, she has honed her Arts in a way that greatly eclipses the complexity and efficacy of the original mode of use.\nWhether using the rise of hot air as a buffer, using the rapid expansion of air around her to generate thrust, or by supercompressing a specific amount of air to create a temperature differential capable of causing a small-scale explosion, Blaze has thoroughly understood how to utilize her Arts.\nShe is also capable of using her own blood to enhance the effect of her Originium Arts, with a greater usage of blood corresponding to a greater increase in efficacy.\nThough sometimes mistaken for a Caster, all illusions of such are quickly dispelled when she approaches them with her heated chainsaw.\n\n\n'Look, what the hell did they decide to write here? Just look at that chainsaw. Do Casters lug stuff like that around? No no, is there anything about her that says 'Caster' to you?!'\n-A fire-based Caster who has chosen not to reveal their identity",

Anything else notwithstanding, her capricious, explosive personality and her likely-to-cause-collateral-damage combat skills have given her a degree of notoriety.\nDespite this, Blaze has an almost perfect track record for completing her tasks. Among the Operators who struggle on the front lines, Blaze is considered as one of the most dedicated.\nNevertheless, regardless of whether the missions she was deployed to all happened to require such firepower, or because Dr. Kal'tsit deployed her specifically knowing her capacities, most of the missions that Blaze participates in are worth solving using these rather... unrestrained methods.\nLiterally, by erasing the source of the conflict, whether it's a dispute over Originium, ownership of a building, criminal activity, etc., there won't be any conflict remaining.\nThis doesn't mean that Blaze will, like some Operators, cause trouble for her fellow Operators or even be forced to act independently. Her ability to work as part of a team is also one-of-a-kind. In fact, a team with her as the main attacker can safely focus on supporting, defending, and completing other mission objectives, because Blaze can single-handed absorb all the combat pressure for them.\nWould any team refuse a proposition like that?\nAs a matter of fact, yes. Quite a few, actually. Because Blaze's techniques and tactics are often risky and sudden, even if she is capable of achieving the greatest results, only the most capable of team members are able to keep up with her.\n'Please enter freefall from 300 meters,' she will often say.\nWhile she reassures them, 'Don't worry, I'll catch you,' stuff like that is not well-received by the faint of heart.\nOver time, Rhodes Island has come to trust the young and enthusiastic elite, though not enough to treat her as a role model.\nJust don't. Whatever you do, don't try to become another Blaze.\nHowever, trust does not only come from the recognition of strength.\nBlaze is committed in fighting for the rights and interests of the Infected, never wavering in her convictions.\nShe is firmly on the side of the Infected, and stands with all who fight for a just cause.\n'You know she's trustworthy because she puts her life on the line for you.'",

Train, train, and train more to wield heavier and stronger equipment.\nIf you aren't durable enough for the job, or if you hurt yourself with your own Arts, find a way to overcome it. Bring more medicine, install a special pacemaker installed by a friend, get back onto your feet even if your head is spinning, and join the battle again.\nIf your combat skills still have deficiencies, then throw yourself into the most brutal battles, and make up for the lack of skill with experience. Arm yourself with the instinct that you've honed over countless battles.\nAfter that, integrate your Originium Arts into all your efforts. \nEven if your exam results can't get any better than 'Excellent,' all the power you've mustered on the battlefield can bump that up to 'Super Excellent.'\n\nThat's what it means to be an elite Operator of Rhodes Island.\nOf course, she still scratches her head when trying to slog through basic textbooks for her upper-level courses. But she does get through it in the end.\nSee, such is the nature of an elite Operator.\n\n--■■■",

It's just complicated enough for you, right? Just listening to that huge string of numbers makes my head want to explode.'\n'No. It's because of a predecessor of mine.'\n'Care to explain?'\n'The year I'd just assumed Deputy Minister duties at the Central Judicial Office, I'd been rummaging through files in light of a case I had, only to find that in order to fell a great villain, he'd employed counterfeit evidence at their impeachment. Despite him already being retired at the time, I convinced the Censor to recall him to the capital for punishment.'\n'Uh, I'm not going to weigh in on whether that was right for you to do or not. Can I ask what this has to do with me?'\n'I only later came to know that said predecessor had not retired under normal circumstances, and was frankly not in his hometown caring for his family as one would assume... He'd concealed his identity and been appointed to chase down a series of unsolved cases... At the time, he'd practically figured out the third child's whereabouts, and it was exactly then when I just so happened to learn of his early mistake—what are you doing? Stop rubbing my shoulder...'\n'You were used. Which also means, if it wasn't for this case, my dad's whole deal would've come to light forever ago, huh?! No need to pull that face, I'm not blaming you for this. All I can say is that this is a real complicated affair... Don't let me interrupt you, go on.'\n'At the time, your father had suddenly been given a transfer. He departed for Victoria; in the two weeks following my predecessor being taken into custody, the Central Judicial Office scrollery suffered an inexplicable fire one night, and all the south's documents were reduced to ash... The Tianshi are correct. As a Central Judicial Office Deputy Minister, I must investigate the truth of this matter, and to do so, I must renounce my very Central Judicial Office Deputy Minister status... hence why I must take it on now.'\n'You can't give me that again! Tell me everything you know, now. All of it. Chop-chop.'\n'No. You can't help me. These days, you are no more than 'a Victorian lodging aboard Rhodes Island.' You need only tell me what <i>you</i> know, all the things you've been through, and you can leave the rest to me.'\n'And I call that crap! The guy who died the land's most inexplicable death in a whole other country was my dad, not yours, and the woman who's dead according to her official paperwork and had to spend so long without a life except one on the move is me, not you. You may as well have never taken your mask off here, if it wasn't gonna make you any better at talking to me! Jeez, I know what you're worrying about, but there's nothing to fear! I'm an Elite Operator of Rhodes Island! Have you seen me with my chainsaw or not? Have you experienced my heat or not? I don't CARE how complicated the case is or how many enemies we've got, you think they get to burrow away in the shadows their entire lives?'\n'......'\n'...Oh, yeah, did you mention just now your predecessor chased down that third kid's whereabouts?'",
