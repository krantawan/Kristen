            "storyText": "Even though she denies it, it is clear that Asbestos is a true explorer. Of course, she is very different from Magallan. \nOn one hand, Magallan is employed by Rhine Lab. Though the desire to explore the frozen tundra was her own, the core reason she undertook her exploration had a great deal to do with Rhine Lab. Additionally, Magallan's exploration was better planned and thoroughly measured. \nOn the other hand, Asbestos's exploration is completely amateur - nobody asked her to do it, and nobody is backing her financially. She merely follows her own ideas, walking around and recording her observations in her travel notes and publishing them in magazines. \nIn fact, almost all active explorers on Terra are affiliated with either some country or company, such as Magallan is, and explorers with no backing, such as Asbestos, are very rare. Realistically speaking, a desire to explore the world cannot be fulfilled solely through courage, but requires capital as well. \nThough Asbestos is reluctant to reveal her background, we can surmise that there's likely nothing exceedingly bad or traumatic. As for why she decided to become a maverick explorer, Rhodes Island does not intend to pry too much. That is to say, on this point, she differs greatly from Magallan. \nAs for the differences in their views on exploration, Asbestos claims that she's just 'in it for the excitement.' While it is true that when we mention explorers, we often have an impression of them as being pioneers, trailblazers, delvers into the unknown, or torchbearers for those who come after them, etc., none of these are substantively different. \n'Opening the way for those in the future' is generally the result rather than the cause. For example, while Magallan has always wanted to be an explorer, that desire fundamentally stems from her longing for the frozen tundra. Rather, those who try to act out of one of these clichéd ideals of righteousness usually end up giving up halfway through. \nFrom the footprints that Asbestos has left and the records she has taken, there is no doubt that she is an excellent explorer.",

As a matter of fact, she even revels in that animus, especially when people say it to her face. She understands that the true way to alienate others is not to rudely refuse, but rather to be calculatingly evasive, or to be ambivalent. \nRather than saying she doesn't understand interpersonal relationships, it's more accurate to say that she sees them far too thoroughly and hasn't chosen not to maintain certain norms after recognizing all of this. \nLike Magallan, she knows how to endure loneliness, but a major difference is, one of Magallan's greatest motivating factors is the fact that someone is waiting for her. Asbestos, however, has no need for such motivation, nor is she trying to compensate for that with something else. She simply has learned to draw her motivation from other things. \nIt's little wonder that some operators think she's very cool. She's willing to bear the consequences of her decisions, alone. \nEven though we have no way of finding out about her past without her cooperation, based upon the result, she claims to actively want to be a 'jerk' that antagonizes everyone, and is intent on staying that way until the end of her life. \nIt is not for us to judge whether her lifestyle is correct, nor do we expect her to change. However, from Rhodes Island's standpoint, we always hope that operators will be able to trust us. In this respect, Asbestos may be one of the most difficult operators we've ever dealt with. \nHowever, thanks to the Doctor's persistent efforts, Asbestos is now willing to recognize Rhodes Island as the company behind her, and she has made respectable progress.",

But, as mentioned in a previous file, Asbestos's great strength is that she can always accept the consequences for her decisions. Because she accepted this reality, there is no way to really blame her. \nOf course, the life of an explorer also facilitates her liberties in a certain sense. After all, she has very little contact with people except for those needed to refill her supplies. \nBecause Asbestos's autonomy does not infringe upon other people, the biggest victims are probably the Doctor and certain operators who are trying to establish a good relationship with her. Therefore, Rhodes Island will continue to uphold its consistent policy of not interfering with the private lives of its operators. \nBut even if that is the case, just as she insists on living life her own way, Rhodes Island also has something it insists on - we will never let her die as she wishes.",
