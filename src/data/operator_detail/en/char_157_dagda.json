Dagda has smooth and precise combat skills that are highly accurate and effective when attacking.\nHowever, unlike Indra and Morgan, she tends to keep her distance from the other operators outside of missions, and may even appear somewhat antisocial to others.\nDespite this, Dagda is not a cold-blooded warrior. During an outdoors mission, she once watched over a few heavily ill Infected for several nights without sleep. It may be that she is not good at expressing her feelings because her past experiences required her to keep calm, but time and again she has proven that, like other Rhodes Island operators, she will lend a friendly helping hand to anyone who needs her help.",

This may seem at odds with her somewhat solemn personality, but when asked why she chose that attire, she always answers matter-of-factly: 'Because the mission calls for it.' As a Knight of the Tower who escaped from the Sarkaz, she and Siege are used to concealing their identities, and her clothes, which could not be more different from the Knights' accoutrements, have indeed been effective at keeping her undercover.\nThat said, she seems to have a hidden passion for fashion, as evidenced by the magazines and mail-order accessories she hides in her dorm room. She can often be seen at Operator Aciddrop's hallway skateboarding competitions and Operator Vigna's midnight cafeteria rock festivals. It wasn't long before everyone started to know her as not just the 'Knight of the Tower' or the 'Glasgow Member' Dagda, but also as the 'punk girl' Dagda.\n'Who got her this nervy anyway? When we were out drinking, picking fights, she'd either be spouting off about the Knights of the Tower's code of conduct or practicing her sword skills with a proper serious face on. It's been ten years, but even though she's left for so long, all she ever talked about was her duty... Indra and I were sick to death of hearing about it. Maybe this hobby is her way of letting off some steam? Could be something like a late rebellious phase.' — Morgan",

If you're proper riled up about it... come have a go at me. Blow off some steam.'\n—Excerpts from Dagda's recording of the lesson Indra gave her on how to fight\nIn addition to the voice recording, Dagda also took several notebooks worth of notes, which included the signals for specific moves and detailed combat summaries. Her first few fights recorded in the notebook were all against Indra and Morgan, and from these notes, it appears she was frequently beaten up pretty badly.\n'Siege's cautiousness around me is only natural, considering it was the scheming of certain nobles that drove them to leave Londinium in the first place. I shall prove to her my loyalty with my actions.' Dagda held no resentment toward Indra and Morgan when she reflected on their first meeting. 'Why did I keep fighting them after that? It's all practice. It's so that I can pick up new combat techniques... And certainly not because I have any particular love for street brawls!'",

At the age of 16, she took her oath and became a formally recognized Knight of the Tower.\nWhen she was 21, the Sarkaz took over the Parliament Square and laid siege to the clock tower in front of the palace. The surviving 29 Knights of the Tower fought a desperate battle against the Sarkaz under the command of Finn, the Captain of the Watch. All of the other Knights perished, and as the sole survivor, she stepped on the journey to find the rightful successor to the crown.\nWhen she was 23, she returned to Londinium with the Aslan heir. (scratched out)\nWhen she was 23, she returned to Londinium with the other Glasgow members.\n—Draft of Isabelle Montague's page in the <i>Book of the Tower Knights</i>\n<i>Book of the Tower Knights</i> chronicles the lives of all Knights of the Tower, and it is said to have been continuously maintained for several centuries. According to tradition, the Captain of the Watch only records a Tower Knight in the <i>Book</i> after their retirement or death in battle.\nHowever, only a single Knight of the Tower still remains.\nOver the past two years, Dagda has carefully sorted and added to the pages of her 28 fallen comrades. On the way back to Londinium, she once again took out the <i>Book</i> that is her responsibility to keep safe. Between battles, she often stared at its empty pages and spaced out.\nDagda knows that, having sworn to protect the heir to the crown at the cost of her own life in the forthcoming battles, she should perhaps write down her experiences in the <i>Book</i> just as her mentor, Finn, once did.\nHowever, every time she tries to put pen to paper, someone is always there to interrupt her. Sometimes, it's her friends from Glasgow. Other times, it's somebody from Rhodes Island. Perhaps this will help Dagda realize that, as both a member of Glasgow and an operator of Rhodes Island, she still has a long future ahead of her.",

Quite the opposite. I'm worried that the responsibility that's kept her shackled all these years will eventually suffocate her.\nYou saw it yourself. At the Mausoleum of Kings, we saw... the Steam Knights. That was the first time I've seen her so agitated.\nAfter we got out, I thought she'd be pretty shocked, or at least dazed.\nBut she wasn't. She stayed with us, and was just as determined as before.\nThe only difference is that she stopped mentioning the duty and responsibility she was born with all the time.\nI don't know if it was the Steam Knights or what happened to Allerdale that affected her. All I know is that the person who remains by my side chose to do so of her own volition, rather than out of her duty as a Tower Knight.\nShe's my friend, Dagda.\n—From the Conversation Log with Siege",

      "desc": "This round shield sent from Rhodes Island's Engineering Department seems rather plain, but robust and reliable. Apparently it was the result of the Department holding a 'traditional Victorian arms manufacturing competition' in their spare time. 'This was one of the symbols of a knight,' said the Engineering operator to Dagda in their most charming voice, 'so we decided it'd be best to give it to one of the lady knights making the rounds between Rhodes Island and Victoria.' Dagda looks at the shield proudly displayed atop the table, and can't help but think back to the time before she was accepted as a trainee under the Knights of the Tower.\nBack then, other than the strict physical and tactical training regimens, she also took many classes on knightly etiquette. Amongst the grueling and complicated tests of memory and body language drills, this simple round shield had been a major component of them. The historical piece of military equipment was once used daily by knights of old, but the knights of today have long since left theirs at home when marching to war. They would be hung above fireplaces, or used as a nameplate to display one's identity. Expensive paints were commonly used to draw family crests or the coats of arms of various knightly orders. These brightly-colored designs would cover up the shield's own color, just as their delicate etiquette would cover up the inherent violence a knight represents.\nFinn, the Captain of the Watch, once described a scene of the knights and their dazzling shields to Dagda: During the evenings of celebration days, the knights would parade down the street, clad in fine armor and with arms in hand. Their shields with their crests and blazons would proudly display images of their birthplaces, or warriors in various stances, or myriad different flowers, or great sturdy beasts, or checkered patterns one could weave into a net. The crisp rhythm of the military drums accompanied deep horns enveloping the orderly knights, and by the end of the parade they would all face towards the flame atop the tower. But that tower has long since collapsed, and these knightly tableaus now exist only in Dagda's imagination.\n'I've never actually seen the scene my mentor once described to me.' Recovering her senses somewhat, Dagda continues. 'Just like those books that record the exploits of knights long past, and the ones attempting to define whether a knight's life was glorious and honorable, my position as a knight is long gone. If you asked me if there's still anything worth engraving on that...' Dagda takes the shield off to the workshop, where she draws what she considers to be her emblem—a coat of arms from the streets."
