Through this network, many people are able to pick up the mantle of Catastrophe Messenger, and it also provides a source of employment for those who are unable to hold steady employment. Tsukinogi is a clear example of the efficiency of this network. Without a hub of communication and information exchange, there is no way that someone in Higashi could connect with Rhodes Island thousands of miles away using a conventional messenger. In any case, she is now with us, acquainting herself with her new environment, building relationships, and dealing with everything related to Catastrophes as usual.",

The only thing we were allowed to record is that the shrine built atop the mountain maintains a stable, cooperative relationship with a Buddhist temple at the base of the mountain. According to our assessment of the situation, the locals seem to recognize the teachings of both the shrine and the temple, suggesting that the two faiths have been intertwined in practice for some time now. Such a thing is virtually unheard of here. Is this a common practice in Higashi? It has come to our attention that Tsukinogi has disclosed information about what happened afterwards to the Doctor, but the Doctor in turn has not relayed any information to us.

When she has free time, she often goes to the dance room to relax or to teach. While her moves are gentle and agile, flourishing her hands through the air, her feet barely make any noise. As long as she is willing, she can happily spend an entire afternoon with someone with even no dance experience, making them feel as if the two are dancing in harmony. She is familiar with most dance styles from both Higashi and Yan, and is very experienced with the ceremonial Kagura dances. However, this is the one type of dance that she refuses to do. According to HR personnel, her reason for this stems from her belief that Kagura dances are antiquated and dull, and only serve to blaspheme the gods while also making the dancers unhappy. Given Tsukinogi's usually gentle words and demeanor, her strong beliefs in this matter are all the more convincing and are perhaps related to her unwillingness to become a shrine maiden.",

With her mysterious rhetoric, a few simple Originium Arts techniques, and her charming personality, there are many people willing to go out of their way to accommodate her. As a result of almost universal praise and adoration, Tsukinogi naturally was painted with an aura of benevolence, and was able to establish a vast relationship network. Of course, unlike people who network for the sake of money or benefits, Tsukinogi embraced an altruistic and dedicated approach to dealing with others. This was, after all, the reason she became a Catastrophe Messenger in the first place, and is also the reason why her initial probation period was half the duration of most other operators. The operator who compiled Tsukinogi's file was originally distressed about the fact that the Doctor had been keeping secrets regarding Tsukinogi's past, but after talking with Tsukinogi, that operator has since become a firm supporter. By the looks of things, she is better than most Catastrophe Messengers at earning the trust of others. \nAs for this trust, Tsukinogi credits all of it to the Doctor.",

Isn't that actually Taisha?!' \n'Yeah.' \n'Her family name should be a one-character name then.' \n'Yeah.' \n'I got it.' \n'Her family name is Elafia.' \n'Unknown Higashi dialect)' \n'I don't even know how I'm supposed to greet her anymore.' \n'What does she call you now?' \n'Ahaha...' \n'Stop laughing, just tell me.' \n'S-sir. Hehe.' \n'Well, why not just keep things the way they are?' \n'Yeah, I should.' \n......\n'Why do you think she joined a Catastrophe Patrol then?' \n'She says she was tired of the Kagura nonsense, but I don't buy that for a second.' \n'It must have something to do with the Catastrophes then. Maybe she felt like trying to save a few more cities was more worthwhile than dancing in a shrine?' \n'Have a little more respect, will you!' \n'Woah, calm down, she doesn't even care.' \n'But I care!!' \n'Fine, fine, respect, respect.' \n'To be honest, she probably was Higashi's best Catastrophe Messenger. Judging from the files she's provided, her successful early warning ratio is twice as high as ours here.' \n'As a Catastrophe Messenger, the most important thing besides being able to warn someone about an impending Catastrophe is having that person believe you. Even if our Messengers report the matter, city officials often do not comply.' \n'But not the case with her.' \n'After all, she is a daughter of Taisha.' \n......\n'Have you checked the approximate location of the Catastrophe that resulted in her contracting Oripathy?' \n'It's not far from her hometown, and Taisha would've been within its affected zone.' \n'It happened during a big festival, and there were people everywhere. In the end, it's excusable that they couldn't evacuate the entire region.' \n 'After all, in order to prevent disaster, it is not just enough to persuade the believers to leave - everyone near the entire site had to be persuaded to evacuated.' \n'And she almost pulled it off, except for one little bit.' \n 'She managed to evacuate cities small and large alike, but in the end, it was her own family that would not listen to her?' \n 'After all, the public can heed the words of a Kagura-dancing heiress to the shrine, but at the same time...'\n'Yeah......'\n'Man proposes, God disposes, huh?' â€”Excerpt from a recording of a conversation between two HR personnel",

      "desc": "The mist has not yet lifted from the mountains; still the hazy circle of the moon climbs through the sky. The moonlight is a pale and indistinct grey in the color of the fog, like a fine veil tangled about sparse branches, drawing this now-disturbed night into its cover.\nAn insect flies along with a chirp and a skitter, skirting around and around the stone lanterns' light, soon seeming to tire as it alights upon a smoothed rock.\nThe rock suddenly wrinkles, after which a hand swats at it, driving the lost insect away.\n'Oh, when is this fog going to liftâ€”'\nA monk sits by the stone lantern, forcing his all-too-weary face into a bitter smile. One must know, see, that he ascended to pick wild fruits and bamboo shoots while it was light out, but a great mist descended out of nowhere, and left him wandering lost for a spell. Within the dense fog, he saw a vague glimmer of light, and thinking it a sign of habitation in the foothills, he followed after it only to find it was but this rough and moss-covered lantern.\nBefore he realized, the fog grew thicker. Forget the way down; now he couldn't even tell where a single step forward would land his foot. The monk could only sit and rest here for a while, accompanying the lantern until nightfall.\nAll of a sudden, he hears the clear peal of a bell. The monk rubs at his drowsy eyes, and what should he see but another faint light in the fog. Not like the one before, for this one floats straight towards him.\nThe sounds of unhurried, sure-footed steps draw near, and thereupon strands of faint blue and mottled white streamers brush by the lantern's brim. By the moonlight's glow and lantern's faint shine, the monk sees, finally, the face of his visitor.\n'You're... You're from the shrine at the summit...'\n'Spring is well on its way in the mounts. Haze settles most easily around this time. It seems you do not know this mountain.\n'You must be new, from the monastery at the foot?'\nAfter such a greeting, the monk is unsure how to respond for a spell.\n'Worry not.\n'Though I serve the gods at the summit, I would hardly stay at the shrine in my day-to-day.\n'Offering aid to those who've fallen on the mountain, and guiding the way for those lost in the mists, are closer to how I interpret such 'sacred' servitude.\n'As for why you came, and why your plight should be here, I will not pursue the question.'\nThe monk is still skeptical, but the visitor raises her staff, its streamers encompassing points of light and mist, and then after another ring of a bell, the mist scatters some. The narrow way gradually grows clear within the forest, and lifting his head to look, he faintly makes out the Hanesu that stands sentinel on the path to the summit.\n'Let us go. It is still far to the monastery at the foot.\n'Rest the night at the summit, and once day breaks and the mist dispels, I will send you back down.'",
