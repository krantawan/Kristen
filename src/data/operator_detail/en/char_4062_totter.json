Besides coming in for mission reports and routine inspections, he spends his time either tucked away at his cabin in the Victorian forests or out participating in missions.\nHe has not interacted with many operators, but among those who have gone on missions with him, not a single one will deny his observation skills and execution abilities. Any mission he participates in will see a markedly increased chance of success, as he organizes tricky mission objectives and breaks them down into clearly structured sub-objectives based on their priority. Following these mission plans often achieves good outcomes for the team. Though some have criticized his methods as being inflexible, this is the best option available to him due to his limited stamina and restricted mobility.\nAfter experiencing the Londinium incident, Totter decided to fully retire, leaving behind his bloodstained past and returning to the uninhabited forests of northern Victoria, living off the land as a hunter. Nowadays, he looks calm and at peace, discussing the happenings in his life in a lighthearted manner. The heavy smoke, smell of rust and disinfectants, and unending screams that once dominated his life have gradually receded, replaced by firewood, hot tea, the smell of pinewood, and the crunching sound of tree branches under his feet.\nHowever, from time to time Totter's straightforward manner of doing things will remind us that the things which have long taken shape within his bones are just waiting for a chance to emerge again. No matter if he is willing or not, that will not easily change.",

Under ideal weather conditions, his long-sightedness allows him to easily see targets a hundred meters away, track the target's slightest movements with the naked eye, and make a decisive judgement to take them down.\nThe hunting skills he acquired in his youth became a great foundation on his path to becoming a sniper. He was born in a small, remote rainforest tribe in Sargon, far away from civilization. The hunters in the tribe had passed down their skills from generation to generation, accumulating a wealth of hunting knowledge. Totter's father was also an experienced hunter of the tribe, and passed on their skills of identifying the terrain, predicting the weather, and picking out prey to a young Totter. Totter lived up to the tribe's expectations, quickly picking up those skills and standing out among his peers. Besides that, Totter also possessed a trait that allowed him to become a distinguished hunter—patience. In the hot and humid rainforest, lying dormant and waiting quietly is a nearly impossible task, but Totter was able to rely on his extraordinary patience to lie in wait for an entire day for his prey to come into range. This would also prove to serve him well in his life as a mercenary.\nAfter entering adulthood, he traveled across Sargon, Columbia, and Victoria as a mercenary for hire, venturing into all kinds of places and participating in all sorts of complicated battlefields. To kill his target, he would lie in wait alone for days, deep in the mountains in the harsh winter, or crouch unmoving in the boiling hot sands of the desert under the brilliant sun. Totter never included these extremely boring, difficult, and lonely waits in his reports, merely ending them with a simple 'Mission Complete.'\nTotter is quite particular in his choice of weaponry. His arm strength is good, and the arrows he carries are modified versions of the specialized hunting arrows his tribe used to hunt large targets. These large and powerful arrows have been used multiple times on the battlefield to ease the burden on frontline operators, and their efficacy is obvious.",

He has a room in his cabin used exclusively to store his collection of snow globes, and the crossbow he carries everywhere also has snowflake ornaments on it. He even secretly includes expenses for buying snow globes in the receipts he sends us.\nBased on the exchange records, Totter attributes his love of snow to a snowflake specimen he saw as a young child, left behind by a Victorian merchant caravan passing by the rainforest tribe. Its intricate design led Totter to long for the snowy vistas the merchants described to him, and also evoked his imagination of the lands outside. From then on, Totter changed his mind about staying in the tribe and decided to leave his home after coming of age.\nHowever, that which starts from a single snowflake will inevitably be buried by layers of thick snow.\nAfter leaving his home, Totter met and befriended some close friends, and they formed their own mercenary squad. After taking in many trained combat personnel, the squad gradually took shape and started to gain fame. Just as everything was going swimmingly and everyone was filled with hope, a freak accident caused half the squad to perish. Totter himself was infected with Oripathy in the incident, and lost almost all his mobility. Unable to keep up with the others, he was left behind deep in a forest. Being close to the Snow Realm, that forest was often hit by sudden blizzards, turning what was once a sunny day into one full of heavy hail and frost.\nTotter once admitted that he fell into a deep depression for a long time after leaving the mercenary squad, until one day when he was lying drowsily in bed due to the effects of his pain medication. The howling wind of the blizzard outside had gradually died down, leaving the area in silence as a single beam of sunlight shone on his closed eyelids, waking him from his nightmares. As he glanced towards the window, on the pure white forest floor outside stretching into the horizon he saw several thin and leafless fir trees stabbing viciously into the cloudless blue sky. Miraculously, Totter felt nothing but peace from this sight. He no longer felt pain and sorrow from being left behind, and was finally able to accept and feel relief towards the misfortunes that had befallen him.\nHowever, during that conversation, I noticed Totter kept his eyes on the floor, and licked his lips several times. It was obvious that he was hiding something. Despite my questioning, he stubbornly refused to reveal anything to me, and even began to avoid conversing with me.\nTotter's behavior worries me. Perhaps he buried more than pain and despair within that snow. I couldn't help but come to a horrifying thought. Did he really manage to walk out of that flawless snowfield, that bitterly cold winter?",

He forgoes any semblance of table manners, instead gulping down the soup without much chewing.\n'You don't need to worry about me, I'm fine.'

It's too hot, everyone's always sweating.\n'Life's pretty boring, too. The only thing there is to do is chase the animals around every day.\n'I believe I'm meant for more. What do you think?'\nHe swung the arrow a few times before nocking it gently into the bow.\nThe arrow flew off into the distance, beyond the reach of his sight.\n\n'You should get out of here,'\nHe bowed his head and refused to answer as he continued chopping wood with his axe.\n'In a few days, a group of mercenaries will come, and they are in need an archer. I think you're perfect for the job.\n'You'll travel through a vast forest, traverse fields of waving wheat, and ultimately arrive at a small town in the south.\n'It rarely snows there, and the trees stay green, even in winter. It's warm enough wear only a single layer of clothing.\n'You'll make new friends there, save some money, and maybe even find a lady to spend your life with.\n'You shouldn't stay here. It's too cold, and snowstorms come in the winter.\n'Look around you. There's nothing to do here. The only thing that comes close is hunting.\n'I believe you're meant for more. What do you think?'\nHe weighed the axe in his hand and carefully placed it atop the pile of wood. He remained silent and merely rubbed his teeth against his lip. He kept at it for a while, enjoying the sweet, tangy taste in his mouth.\nFinally, he spoke.\n'No, I'm fine here. I should stay.'\n'What are you even staying for?'\n'I'm waiting.'\n'For what?'\nHe fell silent again. He had no answer to this question.\nFor the storms to subside? For the snow to melt?\nOr maybe only for an arrow, shot by a young boy, to break the bounds of time and space, with the courage of ignorance and naive bravado, tearing through the layers of his life's disguises, to pierce his very heart.\nThen, his heart would shatter, only to light up once more, filled with warmth anew.",
