His father, Pancho Salas, joined the 'True Bolívarians' local resistance force because of his patriotic ideals, leaving behind his wife and his son.\nDuring the long years during which his father never came home, fighting for Bolívar's independence, Mrs. Salas suffered from a vicious illness that claimed her life after a prolonged struggle that almost lasted a year, leaving the young Ernesto alone. It was not until Ernesto had finished taking care of his mother's funeral that Pancho Salas suddenly appeared at his doorstep.\nAfter that, his father took Ernesto away from his hometown and followed the army through Bolívar. He was sent to join a True Bolívarians prep team, receiving professional military training along with a group of similarly-aged youths. After suffering defeat on the battlefield eight years ago, the old soldier brought Ernesto and Rafaela to Dossoles after three years of drifting and laid dormant within the city, hoping to stage a comeback.\nCompared to Operator La Pluma, who is more pure-hearted, Ernesto has a substantially deeper and more complex view on many things. His five years of living in Dossoles allowed the young man to fully integrate into the city, and the ideas of indulging in freedom and the supremacy of hedonism have had a profound influence upon him. His experiences working under the Mayor have undoubtedly changed his viewpoints regarding various matters.",

In his spare time, he occasionally appears in the bar to introduce various wines to the other operators, finding something suiting their tastes. When a bartender is present, his sister La Pluma in particular, he demonstrates his knowledge of mixed drinks as well and introduces them to other patrons. After all, it is well known that though La Pluma is an excellent bartender, she seldom takes the initiative to talk.\nSecond, after joining Rhodes Island, he found that the company does not object to operators maintaining their own interests outside of work, and as such, he planned to continue operating his weapons shop on the ship — unlike the situation in Dossoles, the mobility of the Rhodes Island landship makes it easier to purchase high-quality equipment from various places. In front of the operators who come to his doorstep as customers, Tequila provides serious recommendations to each guest depending on their actual circumstances and needs. Furthermore, Tequila seems to have made significant inroads with the skilled craftspeople of Rhodes Island, and perhaps the modification and customization of weapons will soon be on the agenda.\n\nFrom the two things above, Operator Tequila clearly demonstrated an adept and ingenious ability to leverage his social skills, bringing his entrepreneurial temperament along with him, well-deserving of his former job as the deputy director of the Dossoles International Trade Management Department.\nHowever, there are certain individuals in Rhodes Island who he struggles to get along with, and Dobermann, an operator from Bolívar, is one such individual. The atmosphere between Tequila and Dobermann was rather tense when they first met. However, Dobermann, who hailed from the same country as him, had more convoluted experiences there than he did, and had a more profound understanding of Bolívar, ironically may have understood Tequila, who hides all kinds of complex thoughts behind a smile, better than anyone else at Rhodes Island. In fact, Dobermann easily saw through his facade and came to regard him as a young man from the same motherland, worthy of nurturing, and keeps a close eye on him. This makes Dobermann one of the few people who can make Tequila visibly squirm.",

            "storyText": "[Classified Log]\nRegarding the events that occurred during the Dossoles championship, Operator Ch'en has already briefly explained the causes and consequences to us in a report, specifically mentioning why she would recommend Tequila and Rafaela to Rhodes Island.\nPancho Salas's long-planned plot fell short, and he will spend a long time in prison as a result. However, Mayor Candela Sanchez saw the championship as a great boon for viewership, and as a result, granted amnesty to all the people participating in the plot with the exception of Pancho, instead removing them from their posts and exiling them, an irony not lost upon us.\nThe siblings, Tequila and La Pluma, were faced with an uncertain future, and Operator Ch'en, after great deliberation, finally decided to recommend the two of them to Rhodes Island. Ch'en believed that she was in no position to pass judgment on Tequila's actions, and also recognized that Tequila was undergoing his own internal struggle. As such, she gave Ernesto the option of trying to apply to Rhodes Island through the newly-established regional branch in Dossoles. In the end, Tequila and La Pluma came to Rhodes Island together.\nWhat must be noted is that if Ernest was the type of person who could disregard the lives of civilians in order to further his own ends, Rhodes Island absolutely would have turned him down.\nHowever, we can rely on Ch'en's pieced-together account of the incident to understand some of Ernesto's thought process. Old Pancho's plan was very difficult to execute, and in order to enable him to smoothly coordinate with the available outside forces, Ernesto, who was in placed in charge of directing the operation, had to attract the attention of the Mayor as well as that of other unexpected players. He had to instigate a certain degree of panic within Dossoles, and also needed to apply sufficient psychological duress on Mayor Candela. To accomplish these ends, Ernesto commanded his subordinates to place a considerable amount of explosives in residential areas... Ch'en's views on these actions are as follows: At that time, the residential area had been temporarily expropriated due to the championship being held, and all residents had been evacuated before the games. In theory, that area would've been the least populated place in Dossoles during that time.\nOf course, this is not to say that Ernesto's guilt should be lessened in any capacity, nor is this to defend him. However, after taking stock of the situation after the fact, we can at least make a definite conclusion:\nErnesto Salas was not interested in creating a moving heap of rubble. Nor did he want corpses strewn everywhere.\nPerhaps as a result of the wars he had seen in his youth and his knowledge of their cruelty, Ernesto did not want to become like the armies in his memories, treating corpses and destruction as trophies to be shown off.",

We were able to discover this without much difficulty when he didn't try to cover it up from us too much.\nOperator Tequila thinks about both his own experiences and also the experiences of the people around him to a great extent, and to be able to maintain this is rare indeed. Obviously, Ernesto disagrees with some of Old Pancho's ideas, but nevertheless, chose to aid his father throughout the Dossoles incident.\nAs for Ernesto Salas, the turmoil of Dossoles and the failure of Pancho Salas was a turning point that helped him make up his mind. Now, the youth have convinced themselves that they've freed themselves from the will and control of the previous generation, and are determined to pave their own way.\nThis way may branch off in a completely different direction than the last generation, but Ernesto has always admitted that he belongs to Bolívar and will likely return there in the future. If there are more young people like him, the situation in Bolívar may experience new change as well.\nThis young man is trying to grasp his own destiny, and we are keenly interested in seeing where this leads him.",
