Get just a little closer, and next second you'll find yourself caught her trap. Then she'll shoot to her feet, free you from it, and tell you in that same old tone that it was just a little prank.

Wish I could see the looks on their faces when they wake up from their nap to find a few extra alarm clocks~\nNotes: Not to be used bedside or on people in deep sleeps, they'll wake up grumpy.\n......\nPeople stuck in combat situations get very sensitive to sounds. That's how they become part of the trap themselves, one after another. Can completely numb the enemy's senses, or alert teammates that they're coming. But not all that practical, on account of all the alarm clocks you'd need. Switch out for appropriate substitute based on the battlefield.\n\n'Invisible Warning Tape'\nThere's a lot of fun to be had with a roll of clear sticky tape. Most classic's when you stick strips all across a doorframe and lead a good friend into it. Watching them get stuck or even trip really brings a smile to your face!\nNotes: Target must however be chosen with care, and watch the mood they're in. If it doesn't turn out funny, apologize straight away.\n......\nAt first I used tactical rope, but nowadays this purpose-developed tripwire has the edge in concealment, weight and price. Based on real combat testing, this see-through thread gets exactly the effect you want, and even marries well with other traps. Gives you a level of lethality from the materials alone, and can be wound in a pinch to work as tactical rope. Considering how all-purpose it is, I should apply for a reel with Logistics next time I'm out on the field. Majorly useful.\n\n'Hollow Cake'\nPreparing this one's a pain in the rear, but especially funny. Hollow out a hole in a cake, fill it with other stuff and then re-cover. Wait for everyone's looks when they come to eat the cake and find 'something nice' inside.\nNotes: Some people don't have very good teeth, so make sure not to stuff anything too hard in.\n......\nYou're not just limited to food when you pull this one in practical combat. Kettles, cupboards, supplies. Just use your thinker, and the world's full of stuff to use against your enemies.\n\n'Me'\nMy mates have always loved showing up next to me from out of nowhere to scare me, which got me thinking: if I use myself to draw their attention, won't it be even harder for them to notice all the little shadows where I've tucked my pranks?\nNotes: People have all their focus on you when they scare you, so you'd best not make any moves and give it away.\n......\nWhat does the enemy most want to see? Me, of course. Me, hurt. Me, dead. The instructors said: 'No hunter hunts forever.' There'll always come a day when a Sniper Operator becomes someone else's prey. So why not... treat myself as bait, and give the other guy a 'nice surprise?' Right, no hunter hunts forever, but there are some hunters who'll disguise themselves as the prey.",

When on field missions with other operators, she rigorously abides by schedules and even raises her own views, all to ensure the mission succeeds perfectly. When on break from field work, she remains aboard Rhodes Island, where she'll assist the instructors by sharing her combat experiences with the reserve operators. Or perhaps she'll take part in some recon and solo operation training, either way keeping her itinerary full. The Kroos of today is a cheerful, good-humored, and self-disciplining woman; she's discarded her bad habits, and strived to excel at what she does. You've long since known that Kroos was worth trusting, but now you can rest easy while she's on almost any assignment, because you know she'll never betray your confidence.\nThe facts have proven as much.",

Everyone told her that.\nBut, after seeing that scar in front of her, she still can't forgive herself.\nShe should've done better.\nShe has to do better.\n......\nEver since then, her sleep's become unusually light.\nShe confirms the rustle of every blade of grass, every sound on the pavement, one by one.\nShe's scared.\nScared of her own negligence, of allowing another crisis to befall a comrade.\nShe's long since been unable to sleep soundly, even aboard Rhodes Island.\nAnd the reward she most hopes for at the end of a hard day's work has changed too, from a neverending dream, to a simple breather on a bench.\nThis, for her and her alone,\nis the price of maturity.",

I thought she was going to chew me out too, but instead she gave me some cake.\nShe must've seen how down I was feeling. But I did mess up, that's a fact. I saw a teammate ahead to my left who hadn't noticed the danger behind him, so I went to go help him. I acted without warning, and didn't expect to get hit by a training bolt. I caused the mission to fail right then and there. The instructors said no one should be making such a basic mistake. I was so embarrassed.\n'Shh. This is from my secret stash~'\nI nodded and gave a bite. It was sweet and creamy, with roasted apple slices on top, and—wrapped chocolates inside?!\n'I was gonna put something in there that'd break your teeth right off, but seeing how you were on the verge of tears, I switched it for chocolate, see?'\nKroos unwrapped one and popped it into her mouth, then unwrapped another for me. We sat on the bench next to the door to the Training Room, and she told me all sorts of things. How she'd made her own mistakes—ones just like mine today—how she'd gotten into massive arguments with her teammates over a disagreement in the field, how she had all these pranks of hers, and how she'd remodeled her crossbow.\nAnd at the very end, I'd finished the cake, and put the chocolate in my bag. Kroos patted me on the head and said, 'You're going to remember today's lesson, aren't you?'\n'I just thought, if I'd seen it but didn't help, I'd regret it...'\nShe gave me a serious look. 'If something does happen for real, regret'll just be part and parcel. Training helps us not make the same mistakes in real combat.' She tossed a toy at me, some kind of prank thing again. 'Use this to give that other operator of yours a fright!'\n'But don't tell anyone I've been stashing the sweet stuff again!'\nA long while later, I'd finally become a formal operator, and I made the correct decision in a crisis. Nobody was even hurt. In a rush of glee, I couldn't help but think of that day, of Kroos's cake and the things she told me.\nI sought her out after I returned to the landship, and once she'd finished taking in my combat report, she showed me something. It was a thick, dense file, with line after line of planned adjustments for the training equipment's trigger timing, and how every Reserve Operator would respond. All in her handwriting.\n'Less regrets this way,' she laughed. 'You did great.'"
