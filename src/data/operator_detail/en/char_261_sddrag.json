Yes, go ask Ifrit if something like this can be called fire.\nLet me reiterate: combustion is nothing more than a reaction. We use Originium Arts to directly control the process of combustion. Whatever this is you've brought in—no, it's nothing alike.\nLook at this diagram. Look carefully at the breakdown... the combustion phenomenon is only a side effect! In fact, this biological tissue spontaneously ignites because it cannot withstand such vigorous cellular activity, which depends on nothing of the flames themselves.\nSimply put, in the first stage, all tissue she contacts is rapidly activated. In the second stage, said tissue uncontrollably metabolizes, and in the third stage, it explodes with enormous energy.\nIf you claim that all her Arts necessarily cause fire, then fine, give me another three months, and I might be able to figure out the underlying mechanism.

I hope that everyone had an opportunity to preview the introduction last night.\nThe lions all claimed to be king, as the Dracos and Aslans each received equal opportunities. Under the terms of this ancient treaty, they were both qualified to become the sole monarch of Victoria. The Dracos symbolized unquenchable thirst for conquest, while the Aslans symbolized power through order. People believed that for countless generations, Victoria was influenced by three forces, including those two.\nLet's not even talk about how many bloody uprisings have been caused by the succession of the throne... Ever since ancient times, people have known that Victoria is not a friendly country capable of handling its own affairs internally. The Aslans originated in Sargon, Leithanien, and even some other countries that have since been wiped out by Catastrophes. The Dracos, who were in power, had no reason to peacefully accept a group of outsiders, let alone allow them to rule their country.\nThe treaty that formed between the Aslans and Dracos could not have arisen in a stable and civilized environment. The most harrowing aspects of this history have been made light of, woven into a prologue for the legends that would follow. In this regard, the oral tradition preserved through gypsy bards and poets can be more reliable than 'official sources.'\nHowever, there are always fragments of truth embedded within legends and tall tales.\nThough a modern state, Victoria has paradoxically sustained its ancient tradition of rule. As early as two decades ago, the Draco bloodline was considered to have been severed, leaving none to threaten the Aslan's firm rule over Victoria.\nWhat happened afterwards was covered in the second class session last month.\n\nHowever, the status quo of Victoria is not the focus of this lecture. What I would like everyone to consider is this: 'Granted that the contract between the Dracos and Aslans was engraved somewhere even more conspicuous than the throne itself, what would happen if there was still a Draco alive out there that could challenge the Aslan rule?'\nNations that had been dissolved, ethnic groups which had been assimilated, civilizations that had been conquered... they all are waiting for a new banner.\nHowever, one must still consider that depending on the nature of the leader, the ideology that takes root - and the subsequent strength of the movement that it grows into - can be quite different.\n\nNevertheless, I still wish to remind everyone that this so-called 'history' is happening around us right now, and the trajectory of the future may not be entirely determined by the origins of the ones who decided to set things into motion.\nAfter all...\nHmm? Look at the time... that about concludes things for today's lecture. For next week's class, I'd like everyone to turn to page 14, and familiarize yourself with the life of a typical Draco king and see how his image in history differs from how it is presented in legend. Then, we will discuss the reasons for these differences.\n\nYou had a question, Miss Istina?\nAh, of course. History is the cause of current events. As for my personal interests...\nWhen the Reunion Movement publicly announced its existence to a small number of political entities, most policymakers decided to respond to the threat of a show of power from the Infected with force; and a small number of them were so concerned that just the appearance of a Reunion leader would trigger an immediate response.\nCombined with the fact that Rhodes Island has secretly received some new patients recently, I am looking forward to a day when these lions will no longer rear their heads. After two fulminating red dragons suddenly emerged from the heir of the lost Draco clans, Victoria may once again be cast into a storm of unrest.\n\n\nHmm, if the testimony is true... there might even be three.'\n\n—Recording of Rhodes Island Lecture No. 43, History of the Empire, Lecturer Hypatia",

Please wait.\nLet me think about this a bit more, about why this young lady's so unwilling to disclose even the slightest bit of information. The truth might not be far from what I originally surmised.\nFirst, she doesn't know if she should trust you, or the extent to which she should trust you. Just like me when I first joined Rhodes Island, I never would've placed my trust in a stranger.\nAnd another reason, which I think is just as simple.\nPerhaps telling you those things would bring about your death, whole and true.\nBe careful.'\n\n—Records of a conversation with Siege",

Open it and try them on, time's a-wastin'... crap, am I spoiling the surprise? The Doctor's not gonna dock me for this, right?'\nThe Vampire engineer hastily covers her mouth, and tiptoes out of the special dormitories, winking at Reed before she shuts the door.\n'Happy holidays!'\n'Happy... holidays.'\nReed holds her parcel, fixed to the spot, unsure if her murmur succeeded in floating past the door.\nFor her, holidays are difficult to reconcile with happiness.\nIt was on the stroke of a holiday that her mother and father died. The gift they'd brought back from Londinium fell at her feet, wrapping stained with blood.\nHer sister dragged her out of the snow, pulling her hand, passing through one alley after another. Candlelight shone on window after window, but nothing lay ahead of them at all.\nWith the footfall behind them drawing closer, her sister told her to hide, finding her the darkest corner to tuck herself in, her chest burning from not even daring to breathe.\n'It's alright now, Loughshinny. Stand up.'\nThe voice of her sister returned to her side. She opened her eyes, saw the firelight creep out from a stranger's window, and it became a strange purple, and malevolent in its very look, scaring even the pitch-black night away.\nHer legs were still too weak to stand. No more did her sister hold out a hand, but went back into the glow of the blaze. She knew that if she couldn't follow, then she would be forever left behind.\nShe grit her teeth and slowly rose up, pushing back the fear and pain, chasing the figure in the firelight. Without knowing it, she ran farther and farther, becoming too but a small shadow.\nEver since, the fire never truly went out. It burned within her eyes, inside her heart, the night of every festivity.\nFive years on, her sister placed a spear in her hands.\nIn her recollections, this was her last time being given a holiday gift. Since then, the flames came to ignite at her spearpoint too.\nSlowly, she became used to the heat, to the scorching that stabbed through her body with each breath. She believed this undying flame would be with her for life, even chasing her in death.\nUntil she received this present.\nShe realizes, and it startles her. So there were people who'd still try to put water to these raging flames.\nIn every test and training thereafter, Reed puts on these gloves, and after the battle, she'll attentively clean her spear's blade according to her manuals.\nShe hasn't told Closure that in actuality, there exists no reagent nor material that can cool a Draco's flames.\nAfter all, when she touched this gift, she truly did feel a long-lost, refreshing chill.",
