            "storyText": "After Gavial saw through her 'trick' and 'punished' her, Tomimi decided to follow Gavial to Rhodes Island and become an operator. Tomimi has little knowledge of life outside her tribe. Her impressions of the outside world come entirely from her conversation with Inam and from the books that were commissioned. When she first came to Rhodes Island, she was the same as two other operators, making a variety of common sense blunders during her trial-and-error phase. However, she quickly completed her transition thanks to her adaptability, and transformed from the leader of a small tribe on the border of Sargon into a Caster Operator with a unique personal flair. \nWhen Tomimi first applied to become an operator, some of the other operators in charge of the testing process initially were opposed to letting her become a Caster. In the eyes of Casters who have been trained under the theoretical framework of modern Originium Arts, Tomimi's use of Originium Arts is brutish and backwards, particularly her preference towards melee combat which runs contrary to what is typically required of Casters. When the testers gathered around to discuss their opinions, one interesting question was front and foremost:\n'What's the difference between her and Gavial?' \n'Gavial wouldn't actually force people.' \n'I think that's only because she's too busy.' \n'But ultimately, they decided to let Tomimi become a Caster, and in terms of her training policy, they did not ask her to conform to the standards of modern Casters and instead allowed her to implement her own fighting style. The reason is, after observing Tomimi's fighting style, they determined that there was some value in studying it. 'Injecting' your own Arts into a wand in order to fill it with lethal power is, from a certain perspective, an utterly fanciful notion. Casters themselves tend to be intellectually curious people as well. After acknowledging Tomimi's combat abilities, a small group of Casters adopted the belief that 'Casters ought to be physically strong.' They even began to hope that a new school of Originium Arts would form through Tomimi's growth— Of course, even if this was to succeed, that'll be some time in the future.",

As soon as this name is mentioned, the normally taciturn Tomimi will instantly open her inner chatterbox, praising Gavial's goodness as if her life depended on her. This degree of enthusiasm may be a match for that of the fans stuck outside the gates of Monster Siren Records HQ waiting for a chance to meet their idols. If you put yourself in her shoes though, Tomimi becoming like this may have been inevitable. Pretend that there's a beautiful young girl. Outside, she's the queen of the playground, and not even the adults can handle her. Everyone wants to be her friend, but she's always at your doorstep, sharing meals with you and asking you to play, showering you with her geniality and grace— What kind of person wouldn't be moved?! Furthermore, this wonderful young girl was stabbed by Originium in the mines in order to protect Tomimi, and ended up contracting Oripathy because of it. Even the bestselling authors of Columbia dare not write such heart-wrenching passages lightly, but this is not a work of fiction. It is Tomimi's truth, and that is why she is so devoted to Gavial. After that, Tomimi dedicated herself to attending Gavial, though the latter mistook this as 'exclusion.' After violently beating down all challengers at the Mahuizzotia, Gavial left the tribe. As for what happened afterwards, please refer to the reports from relevant individuals following Gavial's return from her hometown in Sargon. According to the report summary, the reason why Tomimi thought of using a rocket launcher to shoot down the Doctor's aircraft may simply have been because she hadn't seen Gavial in a long time, nothing more. Tomimi has not pulled any crazy stunts like this since coming to Rhodes Island with Gavial. \n\n'My word, is there really no need to publish a book on Tomimi's antics? A movie would do fine too. They'd be smash hits for sure.' \n'Keep going on about that, if you want Gavial to smack you.' \n'Don't worry, the relevant parties are... a bit slow.' \n'......'\n'Um, in that case, I'll be counting on you for the script for the annual festival.' \n'Change things up a little bit though. We'll get beaten up if they recognize themselves!' \n'You got it. Just leave it to me. '",

            "storyText": "After returning to Rhodes Island, the Doctor asked Tomimi how she had come up with all those terrible ideas. After waffling around for quite some time, Tomimi brought out a number of books that had titles such as these:\n'Only One Step Until The New You', 'You're a Winner', 'Learn Business Management in 100 Days'...\nThen, she took out a list of books that often appeared on the bestseller lists of bookstores, mostly related to fashion, self-help, and management. Without a doubt, the contents of these books gave Tomimi some dubious directions when it came to her understanding of the real world. For example... she really tried to apply this corporate management system to the members of the 'Gavial's Will' tribe, demanding that everyone wear a uniform, shout slogans, and fight like a Lupo (note that she had no idea what a Lupo was prior to joining Rhodes Island). Though the tribe had no complaints due to Tomimi's abilities, after she left, everyone in the tribe quickly lapsed into their old, comfortable ways. With this in mind, the rocket launcher incident was probably inspired by one of these books. \nFortunately, Tomimi was able to pick up a number of practical life skills. She is already familiar with storing items in a limited space, an ability that has earned her the praise of dorm staff. In addition, she is proficient in the use of expedition tools, able to explore the wilds without assistance. Nor will she ever again make the mistake of getting trapped in a mine by accident and putting herself in danger. However, Rhodes Island is different from the hometown of her Acahualla tribe. Gone is the near-infinite space she had back there to store her various collectibles. Under Gavial's persuasion, she has begun to screen her treasures, keeping only the most valuable things in a backpack that she carries on her person. \nAll things considered, one cannot say that Tomimi is unintelligent, but rather, all her energy goes into the wrong areas.",

The dispute betwen 'thick tails' and 'fine tails' still continues to this day. \nTomimi isn't invested in this issue and is perfectly fine with whatever size or length tail she may have, and Gavial is also in agreement. \nNevertheless, her tail is a bit heavy, and sometimes causes inconveniences in day-to-day life. Upon the Doctor's recommendation, Tomimi finally decided to use a tail clamp made especially for Archosaurus use. \nPeople often hear Tomimi lamenting: 'When I was little, my tail was the same thickness as Gavial's. Why'd it end up growing so much more?' \nTomimi couldn't decide whether to keep her tail as it is or to grit her teeth and trim down on it. \nOn one hand, a thick tail is quite popular and can even bring some unexpected benefits on the battlefield. As a bonus, Gavial likes to squeeze it. \nOn the other hand, this tail sometimes poses inconveniences to others, and it may be difficult to find good-looking outfits that can accommodate such a large tail. \nAs a result, this question had been bothering Tomimi for a long time. \nShe needed someone to help her make the decision and implement her choice. \nWho do you think that person was?",

I can even stick my tail out between the seat and backrest.\nIt's a bit of a squeeze, but that's fine. The magazine said meditation helps you lose weight, so if I just clamp down where I want my weight to get lost, I bet it'll work even better.\n\n'Keep your body upright, don't lean back. Let your tail hang down naturally, and put your hands on your lap if you want. Relax your shoulders. Keep your airways open. Relax your core.'\nNo, I think I need to sit a little more firm.\nI cut out Gavial's signature from a medical history file last night. I need to be ready, just in case she comes looking for me.\n\n'First, we'll do some deep breathing. In... out. In... out.'\nIn—out—in—out—\n\n'And we'll repeat that, twelve times in total. In... out.'\nThat's so many times—wait, no, I need to stay focused! In, out! In, out!\n\n'Feel... your inner... peace.'\nMy cheeks are all hot. Does this count as peace? I guess so.\n\n'Close your eyes. Let all your pressure fall away. And then, inside your mind, picture a beautiful wish.'\nBeautiful wish? I want to be able to help Gavial out!\nIf Gavial wants to be a doctor, then I'll sort out everything else for her! I'll lead the tribe, I'll be a lord ameer, I'll even fight the fights I don't want to!\n\n'And then, hold that beautiful feeling inside your mind.'\nAnd then Gavial will praise me for doing good, and she'll say, Tomimi, you're the one I can count on most, you're always helping me out with stuff—\n\n'Now before your eyes, a beautiful scene is going to appear.'\nGavial... in front of me... telling me I'm the most reliable ever?!\nWaaaaaahhhh!\n\n'Now focus on your breathing...'\n'Yo, Tomimi. There you are.'\n'Ga-Ga-Ga-Ga-Gavial! Have I been helping you out?'\n\n'Don't try to control your breathing. Concentrate on the feelings that surround it...'\n'Huh? A bunch, I guess.'\n'Really?!'\n\n'Don't try to follow any thoughts...'\n'I mean, not the time with the rocket launcher. But down in Zeruertza, and when we headed back to Acahualla, right? You were right there helping me—hey, hold on, quit swishing your tail. You're gonna wreck that chair—'\nCrash.\n\n'Imagine yourself inhaling pure energy, exhaling your muddied, negative emotions...'\n'Gavial gave me that tail clamp just yesterdayyyyy!'"
