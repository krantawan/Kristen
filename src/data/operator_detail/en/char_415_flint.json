There have been plenty of times where a single flippant comment made someone throw down right in the corridor. Sorting out all those scuffles is a pain, but the fact that they happen in the first place doesn't really surprise anyone. Operator Flint's case, however, is somewhat distinct from this. \nWe've had a lot of operators who've 'compared notes' on physical combat with Flint testify that actually, the fights that unfolded between them were with both sides' mutual discretion and consent. No bad blood at play, no clash that sparked a conflict. In most situations, this short girl stares straight at her target, walks over to them, opens her mouth, and lets loose some strange syllabic utterances. The two then recognize something implicit in the other's gaze, and then put up their dukes. \n'I didn't understand what she was saying.

It worked better than anything anyone else had to say, and Flint began to study seriously. \n\n[Voice Log]\n'So what do we do until she learns? There's nobody else around who can make sense of her native dialect. Do we just wave our hands at her?' \n'Oh. Don't you worry about that.'\n'What's not to worry about?! Missions! What do we do about missions? Okay, do we use body language to give her orders in the middle of the battlefield, too?'\n'Relax, relax.

The tribe of Liberi she comes from is naturally of small stature, and it's apparent that their physical fitness compared to other Liberi falls slightly short. One need not even start comparing them to the wealth of combative, healthily robust races surrounding them. This is why Flint's tribe has always had a relatively tough time living in the rainforest. These challenges persisted up until Flint reached the age where she could run and jump, at which point she promptly picked and won a fight with two Archosauria who substantially outclassed her. She beat them on their own ground. \nFlint's fists are fast and tricky. Where she falls short in terms of naturally endowed strength, her race's superiority in speed makes up handily for the deficiency. Her fighting style differs from any boxer with a grounding in theory. She wields her fists to knock her opponent down, pure and simple, and they carry an almost illusory sense of the freedom and danger of the rainforest. \nAs the tallest and strongest warrior in her tribe, Flint was always quite confident of her own build, even proud of it, until she came into contact with other, much taller peoples. Once she came to the realization that most of the entire outside world's population was of much greater stature than her, Flint was quick to give up her arrogance born of ignorance, and she began seeking out new challenges. She went to find those stronger than herself, challenge them, harden and mold herself, improve herself, until she could beat them. \nDo not underestimate her for her size. No Sargon warrior ever feared a challenge. \n\n[Addendum by file author]\nI will refrain from putting her relationship with the taller operators into words. On the other hand, she gets along with our operators of Durin origin. No question about that.",

            "storyText": "One might expect that in their reverence for might and strength, the Tiacauh would be impulsive and unruly. But we must admit their conduct is full of great fervor, candor and a masterful valor. Operator Flint is an archetypal example of this. \nAs Flint sees it, there is nothing that can't be settled with her fists some way or another. Back in Flint's old stomping grounds, you'd often catch a glimpse of Tiacauh people who'd been wrestling with each other just a moment ago, who'd stood themselves up straight, shook hands and made peace with each other the very next second. After that handshake, they might wrap their arms around each other's shoulders and go off to eat together. Though, generally, they'll get into another fight because of something else altogether before they can sit down. \nIn addition, the Liberi people to which Flint belongs have a love for flowers that far exceeds the norm. Their preference is especially for lushly colored specimens, which can be often found adorning their homes. Operator Flint holds the fundamental notion that flowers are something found everywhere, and freely pickable as one wishes. Even now, living in Rhodes Island's colossus of rebar and iron sheeting, she continues to think so. \nAs Miss Perfumer's greenhouse steadily drew in the horticulture enthusiasts one after another, a great mystery reared its head. Flowers would often be picked without warning. As the days went on, the gardeners whose plants went missing ultimately formed an alliance, agreeing once and for all to teach the delinquent flower-picker a lesson they'd never forget. \nBefore they set out a real action plan, Operator Flamebringer's meticulously cultivated bonsai was burgled overnight—a crucial breakthrough. The concerned parties fought each other bitterly that next day, and finally, under the oppressive gaze of Dr. Gavial, they reluctantly shook hands and made their own peace. \n\nAt least Operator Flint now understands. Unlike the rainforest, abundant with vegetation, she should refrain from picking the flowers she finds growing within Rhodes Island. The greenhouse's keeper has allowed Flint the use of a small flowerbed. You can find the Tiacauh stooping next to it from time to time, her hands, so often closed in fists, carefully pulling the weeds, looking forward to seeing the flowers bloom.",

And when she says it, warrior that she is, she's usually already prepared to safeguard you from any danger as you rest.\n\nOnly, you worry how the warrior of the rainforest hasn't yet fully grasped just how vast, and broad, this world is.

The handwriting's kind of immature, and she doesn't need them to remember what the words mean now, but still she hooks them on her belt, the well-worn eyelet fraying day by day.\n'These ones, I brought from home. The rest, I picked on the outside,' replied Kemar once upon a time, when a Rhodes operator was curious about the flowers on her cards. At first, they were how the girl of the rainforest learned her way through other languages—they fascinated her since she was young. Tender little plants. As enrapturing as a flying fist, and they called to her the way the wild things did.\nOn a certain level, these flowers held more strength than any brave warrior. Their names and stories were some of the earliest things Kemar knew by heart: learning how the people beyond the rainforest colored the four seasons with them, interpreted their lives with them. What describes these flowers now are no longer unfamiliar words, but a ring of keys, hung on her waist, opening each of Terra's doors alongside her.\n'Look well, it's our tribe's tallest, mightiest warrior! Her footprints are left in places even our imaginations couldn't reach! And now, she's back!' Kemar parts the grass weave over the doorway, and is met headon with the eager chatter of her tribesfolk, in her native language. Eventually, she stirs; in this most familiar of rainforests, she'll never be needing any 'key'.\nThe tribe's kiddies mill around Kemar, jabbing zealously at all the names on her flashcards' flowers, pestering her to tell all her stories from beyond the forest.\n'Beyond the rainforest... it's very wide.'\nKemar recalls the most exciting moment of her own language-learning Not the first time she understood a spoken word. Not being able to fluently converse with Big Boss Blaze. It was when she realized she could finally explain to others, coherently and clearly, the things that all the flowers of her home represented.\n'...But don't let me tell you about it. You should all go see it for yourself!\n'And then face off with the people outside, and tell them... let them know how mighty we are.' Kemar flips back to the very first flashcard, pressed with a flower of the rainforest. Its power to live is unwavering, and its power to adapt is unrivalled. Rainforest, prairie, or barrens, it will bloom more avidly, more ardently than all.",
