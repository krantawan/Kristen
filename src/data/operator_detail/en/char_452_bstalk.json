Their names are Trey, Twista, B.I.G., Hammer, Ice Cube... and the youngest of the crabs, Peacake, who she keeps in a case she always carries around with her. As their breeder, not only is she able to tell them apart, she also knows the crabs' personalities and preferences. Every day, Beanstalk spends a large amount of time in their pen, preparing their nutritious fodder by hand as well as teaching them new tricks.\nHaving been tamed and domesticated, the Metal Crabs have become much gentler and more alert.

Their shells are hard, they have considerable strength, and the weight they can carry is substantial. At the same time, their body density is low, making them much lighter than they seem and allowing them to complete most of their tasks with relative haste.\nWith such qualities, Beanstalk thought the Metal Crabs would be well-suited to tasks such as mining, transportation, and certain special rescue or prospecting tasks. Her hunch wasn't far off, either. Rhodes Island conducted several tests specifically formulated for the crabs and subsequently issued a detailed evaluation report. Aside from the advantages their breeder previously postulated, the report also pointed out that the animals have potential in areas such as reconnaissance and frontline combat.\nAfter reading the report, the astute breeder immediately went to work and started writing away. Then, after just a week, she had a new proposal for the Doctor about their future collaboration waiting on the desk. In the proposal, the Metal Crab breeder got straight to the point and simply emphasized her one condition: She would go on vanguard missions with her crabs, she would be the only one allowed to give them orders, and she would have the authority to order them to retreat if she deemed the situation too dangerous.\nShe was unwilling to compromise on this demand, and funding was of no concern to her as long as this was met.",

Meeting a fellow breeder is no doubt exciting, especially in such a niche field, and this has both helped Beanstalk become more confident in her career and inspired new business ideas. Supposedly, she has started planning a new product called 'Beanstalk's Fine Pet Food...' I wish her good luck from the bottom of my heart.\nAs a farmland owner, Beanstalk's father is actually not very supportive of his daughter's entrepreneurial endeavors, or more specifically, he does not support his daughter's choice of breeding animal, Metal Crabs, as they are seen as peculiar and incapable of producing anything valuable to the older generation. This weighs rather heavily on Beanstalk. She has no qualms with taking over the family business, but she insists that breeding Metal Crabs is a worthwhile undertaking that will bear fruit.\nShe insists as such not just because she was once rescued by a small cast of wild Metal Crabs when she found herself in an accident out in the wilderness, but also because she saw a huge potential in these little critters. She truly believes that her hard work now will earn her everyone's respect in the future. Beanstalk had an argument with her family over this belief and chose to leave home, hoping to one day make a name for herself and be acknowledged by her family.\nAlthough life has been difficult ever since, Beanstalk has never found herself dismayed by the difficulties she faced. On the contrary, it has only ever fueled her passion and enthusiasm.",

Each year, with nothing but their dreams, droves of young men come to its cities in seek of fame and fortune. At the same time, charmed by its slogans of equality and freedom, a great number of Infected gather at its doorsteps in hopes of reaping the rewards of the plentiful work available to them as explorers; earning a suitable amount of living space; and earning the equal treatment, perhaps even a tiny bit of respect, from the general populace.\nBeanstalk was one such young woman born in Columbia, hungry for opportunity, so she was by no means unfamiliar with the Infected. She wasn't very bothered by the work environment here either, daunting as it may be. She understands that it isn't easy to chase after your dreams, and in a place like Columbia, there are just as many passionate dream chasers who pour into its cities as there are unsuccessful washouts who leave the cities behind. The Metal Crab breeder thought she had both what it takes and the dedication to make it, but her failures have forced her to admit that all successes also need that tiny bit of luck.\nNow that Rhodes Island has finally given her a chance, the young lady has come to realize that, just perhaps, her luck has finally arrived.",

Lemme have a look!'\nThank you for choosing the 'All-You-Crabs-Eat' smart metal crab feeder! This device uses cutting-edge smart technology to solve any issue you may run into while raising metal crabs. Racked with worry that you can't tend to your crabs while away from home? Afraid that ordinary feeders could incubate harmful bacteria that will affect your crabs? Well, worry no more! The 'All-You-Crabs-Eat' offers your crabs a nutritionally balanced diet, all pre-portioned according to the latest science!\n'Sounds good, but what's this 'cutting-edge smart technology'?'\n'Oh, I asked Mayer to help with the computer interface stuff. In return, I lent her Peacake to help her develop a biomimetic intelligent partner.'\n'I see...'\nIf you're using this device for the first time, please follow the illustrated instructions to assemble the feeder and food barrel, then use the touchscreen to complete your device's basic setup. The 'All-You-Crabs-Eat' offers three preset feeding schedules, and can support up to ten additional custom schedules. And if you can't bear to miss the wonder of even a single feeding session, order our camera now and enjoy a 20% discount!\n'A camera? Whose idea was that?'\n'I thought of it during training! The instructors stuck some tiny cameras on crabs for a while to assess their combat abilities. So I figured I'd add something similar as an upgrade for the feeder! Cute pet videos are all the rage on Columbia's intercity net, you know!'\nDue to their omnivorous nature, we suggest setting the feeder to a single daily serving, with a serving size not exceeding 10% of the weight of your metal crab. The 'All-You-Crabs-Eat' supports freeze-dried feed, and requires no pre-crushing. We recommend using it with 'Beanstalk's Fine Metal Crab Feed,' launching alongside the feeder! With fifteen natural ingredients following a carefully developed formula, your crabs will be feasting like kings! Their pincers will grow stronger!\nUsage instructions:\n1. Do not feed children with this device.\n2. Place the device on a level surface to avoid spillage.\n'P.S. While setting up your feeding schedule, please remove your metal crab from the room. Some breeds are extremely intelligent, and may learn to use the feeder.'\n'I-Is that really true?'\n'Of course. That's how Peacake did. And if I'm not careful, she'll invite all her buddies over for a buffet.'",
