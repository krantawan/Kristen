After all, the finest tailored suits in their wardrobe all come from the Tailor de Montano shop. So when the current proprietor, Luchino, expressed interest in joining Rhodes Island, our operators at the Siracusa branch wasted no time sending his resume to the flagship.\nThe arrival of this young tailor didn't cause much of a stir at first—other than Orchid, who was absolutely thrilled. She had written several articles about traditional suits for her personal column, but this was her first chance to exchange ideas with the proprietor of a Siracusan tailoring shop. They penned a few articles together and created some prototype garments. Orchid rolled out some promotional slogans, like 'new looks, new trends' and 'leading a style revolution at Rhodes Island,' making it all sound quite impressive. It seems Luchino was inspired by her enthusiasm; he hadn't expected his craft to find much use at Rhodes Island.\nLuckily, the uniform policy at Rhodes Island isn't particularly strict, and a wave of new fashion trends quickly took root. So if you notice operators wearing pocket squares or trading their tactical jackets for vests and tweed coats, don't be surprised. They've likely given in to Luchino and Orchid's persuasion and volunteered to be models.\nThat said, Luchino does seem a bit irked by the way operators refer to his creations as 'Western-style suits'. 'These clothes clearly originated in Siracusa and spread westward—so why does everyone insist on calling them 'Western-style'?' he wonders.",

            "storyText": "One day, when Umberto was returning home, a giant wolf appeared on the path and stopped him. Using its claws, the wolf showed him how to mend fabric. With its teeth, it demonstrated how to cut cloth. With its tail, it taught him how to measure. The wolf wouldn't let him go until he had mastered each skill. That's how Umberto learned the art of tailoring and eventually opened the Tailor de Montano.\nWhen Figurino was very small, he was swallowed by a giant cloth doll. The doll threatened to digest him and turn him into cotton, but he managed to find the loose thread; when he pulled on it, the doll unraveled. This convinced Umberto that Figurino was a natural-born tailor. He took him in as his apprentice, teaching him all the secrets of tailoring. He even crafted an Arts module for him using threads from the unraveled doll.\nOn nights when the two moons were full, a metal man would sneak into children's rooms to stretch them while they slept. Figurino, determined to avoid a visit from the metal man, painted his eyelids with eyeshadow to make it look like he was awake.\n...\nWhat kind of place is the Tailor de Montano? Orchid has explored it extensively in her column, but it's Figurino's untold stories that are truly captivating. The metal man who stretches children, the giant cloth doll, the giant wolf—these strange and fantastical figures turn the humble tailoring shop into a mystical wonderland.\nOf course, Figurino has never actually seen the metal man, the giant doll, or the big bad wolf. These are all stories that Umberto used to tell him. For a long time, he couldn't understand why Umberto enjoyed tirelessly telling these fairy tales. However, when Figurino shared these stories with the children of Rhodes Island, he saw their eyes light up with curiosity. When he told the tales to young patients, he watched them drift off to sleep, comforted by the familiar words. Seeing these reactions, he finally understood why Umberto kept telling the stories.\n...\n'So... you don't believe in those stories anymore?'\n'Of course not! I've known forever now that grown-ups made them up to trick kids!'\n'Then why were you so scared when that doll that Shamare lost turned up at the foot of your bed?

By the time Figurino turned twelve or thirteen, he had grown tired of Umberto's old tales and went looking for new ones in the streets ruled by gangsters. He developed a fascination with mafia novels and films. He even picked up some slick famiglia slang and learned a few Originium Arts for self-defense (no wonder he performed so well in the operator tests despite lacking actual combat experience). Umberto noticed this but rarely intervened directly. Over time, the street thugs who had befriended Figurino either left the mafia or simply ghosted him. In any case, Figurino's 'famiglia journey' was anything but smooth.\nThey say, 'never meet your heroes.' When Figurino finally came face-to-face with some of the famiglia 'big-shots', he realized that the glamorous Siracusan tales were nothing more than fairytales.\nStill, Figurino remains an active member of Rhodes Island's mafia film fan club to this day. Many Siracusan natives scoff at those films, dismissing them as fantasies made for foreign audiences, but Figurino begs to differ.\n[Post-Screening Discussion Notes]\n'The male lead, Reyna, is so classy!'\n'What's the point of being classy? If you ask me, the strategist, Tomassino, was much more cunning—he was the real star of the movie!'\n'Figurino, what do you think?'\n'Hmm... During the final showdown between the two families, at the marketplace, an unnamed member of Reyna's family gets ten seconds of screen time.'\n'Oh! I remember that guy. He had the chance to take out the opposing leader with a single arrow, but he lost his nerve, ducked down a bit, and missed his shot.'\n'You guys didn't see what really happened?! He ducked to shield a little girl selling oranges from a stray arrow.'\n'Now that guy, that type of character, appears in plenty of other mafia films—young couples who refuse the gangsters' entreaties, old judges that uphold justice to the end of their lives. I've met people like that in real life. They may not be glamorous, but they are the real 'big shots.''",

After Umberto's passing, many clothing companies sought to leverage Tailor de Montano's reputation to establish themselves in the new city. A few of the more prestigious ones reached out to Luchino with offers of partnership. A handful of wealthy buyers came calling, hoping he would sell his shop in exchange for a more secure financial future. He had indeed considered selling his shop, but not because people were offering gobs of cash for it. It was, in fact, because he was unsure if he, armed only with measuring tape and scissors, could manage Tailor de Montano as successfully as his predecessor had.\nThough the shop's future was still up in the air, Luchino personally wrote Umberto's obituary as a sign of respect for the old man. He sent it to every customer listed in the shop's registry, assuming most wouldn't reply. To his surprise, messages of condolence poured in from all over Siracusa. Luchino knew that most of their loyal customers were ordinary Siracusans. Yet their letters were every bit as polished and respectful as those of the shop's most distinguished clients. Some even included advance payments, hoping to secure a few of their upcoming pieces.\nLuchino thought of the familiar fabrics and threads in the shop, the sound of scissors slicing through cloth, and the snap of thread being cut in that tiny workspace. He recalled how those scattered fabrics and threads were transformed into elegant garments. More importantly, he thought of the old tailor who, even as his life neared its end, imbued every single stitch with the same vigor and energy. Now, in the wake of the old tailor's passing, these letters from his loyal customers seemed to tell his final story. It was as if they were reminding Luchino that even with just a measuring tape and scissors in hand, he could craft a legend of his own.\nUmberto's story had come to an end, but Luchino's was only beginning. What kind of legend he would stitch together would be for him to decide. From De Montano to Rhodes Island, the boy who grew up in Siracusa was ready to start a new chapter.",

He remains meticulous and precise, just like the old man was.\nUmberto served as a role model for so many Siracusans, especially Figurino. Though Umberto is gone, his teachings and the example he set continue to shape Figurino's growth. What exactly did the old man teach him? Figurino himself once said that Umberto taught him a craft, 'but also more than that.' There was so much more he could, and did, learn from Umberto, beyond just how to run a well-regarded tailoring shop.

His satin coat was blotched with water; as Luchino welcomed him in, he helped him remove it with deft, practiced motions. The man looked him over, stared for a few blank seconds, then quickly made his way into the atelier where old Umberto had been waiting.\nLuchino would never butt in on a client meeting his nonno; he went to hang the coat on the rack instead. It was a finely made coat, sumptuous material, and most importantly, had a polished black portable crossbow in one of its inside pockets. <i>What a big shot this guy must be,</i> Luchino thought to himself.\nBefore long, an argument arose from the atelier. Fragments of speech stole their way through the door's cracks, and slipped into Luchino's ears.\n'...Luca's stuff... it ends here...'\n'...you're the one... did it... how could you...'\n'...Masina... only girl...'\n<i>Were those my mamma and papà's names?</i> Unable to help his curiosity, Luchino stuck his ear to the atelier wall, but all he caught was the sound of things falling to the floor, and the yelling of that man. '...MY flesh and blood too!'\nThe atelier door burst open, and there the man stood like a wall between him and his nonno. He opened his clenched hand, revealing a silver thumb ring in his palm.\n'This was Luca's thumb ring. It's time you took it.' The man offered it to him, the look in his eyes and tone of his words brimming with expectation.\nPast the man's shoulder, Luchino saw the once-orderly atelier in a state of disarray, fabric bolts and tape measures strewn across the floor, and Umberto shrinking away inside. Luchino had never seen his nonno quite so... weary. He was about to take the ring, but at this moment red-hot rage supplanted all his curiosity. Luchino pushed the man's hand aside, the thumb ring falling onto the rug.\n'Who are you? Nonno and I don't accept rude clients.'\nThe man's expectation promptly vanished, and his expression twisted with anger, his eyes shining green. Luchino realized—he and this man had the same eyes.\n'You are not welcome at De Montano.' Summoning all his courage, Luchino stood up straight, and repeated himself. 'Please leave.'\nThe order cut straight through the air. Luchino shocked even himself to see his words put out the fury in the man's brow. He sensed a hint of discouragement in the corners of the stranger's familiar eyes, but quickly it was covered back up beneath his solemn mask.\n'...As you wish, tailor boy. Arrivederci.' The man put his waterlogged coat back on, then took one final look at Luchino. Then, he exited the shop door and vanished into the rainy black of night.\n'Nonno, who <i>was</i> that man?'\n'A father who'd kill his own daughter. You don't need to know his name.\n'He wants to play Siracusan games, he wants to be a big shot. This is the punishment he deserves.'",
