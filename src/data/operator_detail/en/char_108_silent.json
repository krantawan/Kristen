Once she begins an experiment, she runs through the process like a precision machine, flawlessly seeing it through to the end. Her rigorous approach to the scientific method has earned her great acclaim, with the staff under her just as commendable. \nBut when it comes to interpersonal relationships, Silence is not so gifted, particularly when it comes to dealing with crowds. For example, when attending a party, she has a tendency to live up to her name. This is not to say she is universally introverted though. She draws energy from the serenity of intense concentration. That's simply led to her being more comfortable observing her surroundings in peaceful silence. \nShe is known for her patience and eagerness to listen to fellow researchers. Silence is happy to discuss any scientific research questions from any and all angles. When someone encounters an obstacle in the scientific method, she will hear them out before providing a well thought out answer. Still, as busy as she is in the laboratory, most people don't get to see the communicative side of Silence, except those select few who participate in her research.",

The current, most reliable information comes from Silence's own writings about her experiences as well as other aspects of her life. \nAccording to her recollection, Silence's relationship with Rhine Lab and Originium began during her days as a student, when she accompanied her mentor to the company. \nAt that time, Rhine Lab was holding a scientific exhibition to show off the results of its research from a tour of Columbia. The new medical equipment she saw optimized Originium transmission efficiency based upon new results obtained from live trials, making possible a whole new generation of dazzling treatments. \nAfter completing her studies, Silence's wish came true and she was allowed to join Rhine Lab as an employee. She had an extraordinary talent for Originium Arts, and soon got the opportunity to participate in several experimental projects related to important Originium technology and clinical treatment. \nBut as well as her career was going, and as much as the upper levels of the company recognized her achievements, Silence never forgot her original dream - to join the Originium Technology and Life Science Applications project. \n\n'I never thought the opportunity would come so soon.' \nLooking back on this time, Silence let slip a sly smile.",

It was not fitted with a weapon, instead its only designated function was to provide timely treatment for Operators on the battlefield. \nMedicine that has undergone several rounds of testing by the Rhodes Island Pharmaceutical Team can be assembled into the drone's kits in a variety of ways. The drone can use aerosolized medicine, it can spray, it can inject, and it can simulate a medic's treatment wand. It can switch between these modes depending on the needs of the terrain and the environment, and the specific situation of the Operator in need of healing. \nHowever, this medical drone is still in its experimental stages. Because it needs to be lightweight and convenient, it needs to be a kind of throwaway and relatively fragile low-value target. Additionally, in areas with strong signal interference and complex terrain, its efficiency will be affected to a certain degree. \nEven so, it still provides Rhodes Island Operators with quality treatment.

I figured you'd rather improve its healing efficacy, or maybe durability.'\n'I probably would have thought along those lines in the past, yes.'\nMagallan doesn't say anything. She may spend her days in the tundra year in and year out, but that doesn't mean she's completely clueless about Rhine Lab's internal affairs.\n'I initially wanted nothing more than to be a researcher. I sought to thoroughly analyze the relationship between Originium and life, and I assumed I'd pry open the boundaries of knowledge with my own two hands.\n'But following a string of incidents, I could no longer ignore this: as long as my research doesn't change course, I will never be able to completely exclude the 'human' perspective.\n'Before I started a new job, I first needed to stand in the shoes of a doctor, from where I could examine my own dreams and ambitions. The most basic respect you can afford someone, as I see it.\n'Those drones, then, are the crystallization of my ideology.'\nThe two inadvertently share a glance towards the workshop. Mayer is inside racking her brains; entering hastily was very liable to get you bitten.\n'Speaking as a layman in medicine, I think these drones are already perfect as an extension of a doctor's hands.'\n'Perhaps, but I've increasingly come to realize that merely serving as a doctor... is still not enough.'\nSilence's expression is complicated. She lightly touches her hair.\n'Humans are far more complex than Originium.\n'We can roughly determine Originium activity from its surface appearance. We can predict the ETA of Catastrophes from natural phenomena. We can avoid infection through highly effective protective measures.\n'But how do we determine a person's interior life from what's visible to us? Do falling figures signify deterioration or improvement? Are people with crossbows ultimately there to defend, or to kill?'\n'Just like a snowfield that seems perfectly quiet,' Magallan murmurs to herself.\n'Yes, just like a snowfield that seems perfectly quiet.\n'Therefore, I need tougher measures, so that when the snowfield finally bares its fangs at me, I can protect the people I should be protecting.'",
