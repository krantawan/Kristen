            "storyText": "When our Logistics operator chatted with the sturdy Forte and showed him around Rhodes Island and to his dorm room, she most likely didn't expect that, in merely three days, his room would already have transformed into a terrifying labyrinth constructed of second-hand wares, self-made tools, and a wide assortment of parts. What's even more terrifying is the fact that there are more of these things by the day.\nWith the room having become so jampacked with miscellany that the door could barely be closed, Logistics had a small scare—if it took him only three days to fill his room with all this stuff, it's not hard to imagine how it could start spilling outside in another three days.\nHumus gave his assurance that this would not happen and that he would have his dorm room cleaned up himself. Not entirely convinced, the Logistics operators waited for a week.\nAfter a week, Humus personally invited Logistics to pay his room a visit. Aside from an overall lack of space and the walls looking somewhat different in color, the room was in perfect order. At the very least, it no longer had any junk lying around.\n'Sorry for the trouble,' the Logistics operator said. 'It must've been a lot of work to throw away all that.'\n'I didn't throw away anything.'\n'Uh, what about all the stuff in your room then...'\n'It's all here.'\nHumus said as he reached under his bed.\nThe Logistics operator thought he was going to dig something out and was just about to tell him not to bother, only to hear a bang. It seemed Humus had hit some kind of switch under the bed.\nThen, a large, extendable metal box gradually extended out of what seemed to be merely an excavator decoration. The box kept extending and extending until it reached the floor, upon which its door automatically opened. Inside was an extendable shelf, packed with all the second-hand items, self-made tools, and parts from a week ago.\n'This is a fifth of it,' Humus said from underneath his bed with a slightly stuffy voice. 'Another fifth was used to build the storage system. Do you want to see the other three-fifths? I gotta use the controls under my bed to bring them out of the other walls, though it's gonna take some time.'",

The mindset that best corroborates this is the 'Humus Cycle' well-known among our operators. He made a TV out of bread machine parts. Then, after the TV stopped functioning, he made a space heater with it. Afterwards, he made an electric cooker with its parts.\nWhen Closure caught wind of this rumor, she jokingly gave him a completely rusted metal file cabinet that she had just dug out of storage to see what he could do with it. The next day, an embarrassed Humus told her that the cabinet was so rusted that not even he could make anything of practical value out of it.\nJust as Closure was about to tap his shoulder and tell him that there are things that you just gotta toss out, he took out a handmade burdenbeast figure, made from the last usable bits of steel scavenged from the cabinet. Its head even had two rusted spots, standing in for its eyes.\nIt's thanks to this unique talent that Humus quickly became Rhodes Island's leading waste disposal consultant. Although his suggestions can be fairly outlandish at times, each and every Engineering and Logistics operator admits that his arrival at Rhodes Island has improved our recycling efficiency by a considerable margin.",

For example, he can pick locks with steel wires, unlock popular Columbian terminal control systems without the password, and make coins from scrap metal that visually can't so much as fool a three year old, but can nonetheless be used in vending machines.\nThis kind of 'knowledge' is trivial, unbecoming, and yields little result for the effort put in. Often, he arrives at the outcome without ever achieving a thorough understanding of the process. When given instructions to walk through step-by-step, he will always achieve satisfactory outcomes. For instance, on one pitch-black night, out of plain sincerity, he helped a Perro girl he didn't know unlock the Rhodes Island Cafeteria's kitchen door with a hairpin she found on the ground, and the two helped themselves to all the food they could grab at the cafeteria that night.\nFrom another perspective, his skills have also surprisingly come into use during certain field operations. For example, when the administrator of a nomadic city that Rhodes Island was in discussions with for a potential partnership refused to meet with our negotiator, Humus learned the administrator's usual travel schedule and made some arrangements such that his tire would burst at a stretch of road that he frequently passed through, thus ensuring the two sides would finally meet...\nThere are many other similar examples, and all of Humus's tricks, his obsessively frugal mentality, and his 'inventions' all seem to be have originated from his decade-long tenure in the solid waste disposal plant in the wilderness.",

            "storyText": "[Classified Log]\nColumbia's official advertising campaigns portray the vast wilderness as a place of hope where a man can achieve his dreams. Many of those who come from the frontiers tell us that while they are not without hope, to your average Pioneer, the hope that can be found there is simply too insignificant. And the solid waste disposal plants, commonly referred to simply as 'disposal plants' or even 'landfills,' are the places with the least hope.\nIn principle, the plants are the lowest of all the facilities found on the frontiers, staffed only by criminals allowed to serve their harsh sentences there as Pioneers. Those who work there do not even have the right to leave without permission.\nYet, there are just as many innocents, those who offended the wrong person, and those stubbornly unable to yield any profits who have been sent to the disposal plants. When surrounded by fierce criminals, it is only natural for the place to fall to the lowest of low.\nFortunately, Humus stood up.\nAt first, he was simply a hardy punk, new on the block, who caught Oripathy when handling contaminated scrap metal. But he did not give in after he was infected. Instead, he started using all kinds of junk to put together a set of very bulky protective equipment. Everyone thought he was as much of an idiot as he was unlucky, but right before embarking on another similar mission, the worker in charge of retrieving scrap metal came to him, embarrassed.\nAfter he was done recovering the metal, the man was completely drenched in sweat and exhausted as he got himself out of Humus's protective equipment. Everyone mocked him as 'Unlucky Sap Jr.' However, when out of PR concerns the higher-ups sent a doctor to give everyone at the plant checkups and Oripathy diagnoses, 'Unlucky Sap Jr.' was the only one out of those who had handled the contaminated metal to not be infected.\nAnd just like that, Humus realized that even though he too was just more trash dumped in the disposal plant, at least he had the right to refuse to simply rot away.\nAfter that, things unfolded as naturally as they could be. With the toolbox he used for teardowns and retrofits in his left hand, and a heavy sickle in his right, he made a few things, got in a few fights, saved a few men, and in the end became the boss of the whole disposal plant. One that everyone, from lowly office workers who were wrongly convicted to merciless burglars, looked up to.\nAnd he was only too willing to impart all his skills and knowledge to them, be it how to read and write or how to pick locks. They all knew that if Humus had only a piece of meat left in his bowl, he'd rather share it with everyone else in the plant and drink the little soup remaining left in the pot. Fortunately, thanks to all the little tricks he has up his sleeve, along with his imaginative thinking, such hardships have never once occurred.",

      "desc": "This is a story from when Humus just came aboard.\nHearing they'd gotten a waste processing station's foreman from the Columbian frontier, several operators from Engineering had their curiosities piqued, wanting to see if someone with that kind of work experience had any special skills.\nWhen Humus checked in at Engineering, carrying his heap of trustworthy tools, clearly used for years, everyone present had quite the scare.\nFirstly, the box used to carry them was intimidatingly huge—only someone used to rough work like Humus could carry that thing about by one hand. Secondly, aside from the usual tools was a smorgasbord of bizarrely-shaped wonders whose usages were unclear, enough to perplex anyone who saw them.\nFortunately, Humus is the type who's happy to share. Over the next few hours, Engineering's operators gained a considerable boost to their knowledge.\n'This one's a multifunction remote control, with a lot of leeway for remodeling. Just do this... this... reassemble it quickly, and it'll transform from a TV remote to an RC detonator. It's high-power, has a huge effective range, and it's a treat to use.\n'This one's basically just an average hand cranked dynamo, but with a little souped-up functionality—it can generate electricity while it threshes corn or maybe peels potatoes. We were constantly out of power at the processing station, after all, and usually we only had corn or potatoes to eat.\n'As for this sickle, I made it out of a car door I pulled off. That car was a real funny one—after it came in written off, we had to shelve it for forever because it was just too rugged, and tearing the thing apart took some massive effort. I made the sickle's form overkill enough so if I pull it out and it scares people off, then that's one less pointless fight.'\nIt so happened that moments after the conclusion of this eye-opening equipment seminar, the bell sounded for dinnertime. Completely dazed, the operators of Engineering were itching to take this out-of-the-ordinary new colleague to the canteen for the welcome party they'd set up in advance. At the table, Humus told his curious coworkers a few stories, of people and things out on the frontier that in his eyes were just everyday life. Yet it was only after his captive audience had finished taking in his stories that they realized <i>why</i> Humus had the skillset that he did.\nThe frontier's not a place you survive with just the average Joe's common sense.",
