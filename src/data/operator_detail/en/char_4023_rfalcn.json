Her relationship with the combat experts of Rhodes Island began with a clash of weapons, putting on a show of Sargonian tribal swordplay that the operators in the training room had never seen before. They eagerly invited her to come back for more.\nHer favorite hangout is the bar; although she has been warned against excessive drinking, she can often be spotted doing so from dusk to dawn at the bar for weeks on end. Ultimately, the Medical Department decided to bring her in by force, but Kestrel refused the 'treatment'; being under the influence only seemed to make her sword strike faster and harder. Treatment finally began when her training room friends arrived and successfully restrained her with great effort, only for everyone to realize that treatment was unnecessary after all: unlike most drunks who deny being drunk, Kestrel was, in fact, unimpaired. If anything, the alcohol had only served to hone her swordsmanship.\n\n[Medical Department Audio Log]\n'That Kestrel, from Sargon. Can you believe what her tests show?'\n'What do you mean?'\n'Do you know how much she drinks? Yet it doesn't seem to have any effect on her vitals.'\n'Wish I were like that.'",

This bothered her, as she saw scars from battle as something to be proud of.\nAs she began to blend in, she realized that her 'tooth marks' serve equally well as a conversation starter. When asked about the meaning of a 'guardian tooth mark', she ended up giving a lecture about the meanings of various marks.\n'What would Rhodes Island's tooth mark embody?'\n'That depends on what Rhodes Island is about.'\n'Let's say... 'future'.'\n'My tribe didn't have that kind of mark, but we can invent one.'\nKestrel began inventing her first 'tooth mark' after receiving such a request. Shutting herself in her room, she spent two days drawing up the pattern, and hung it up in the cafeteria to the sound of cheering.\nAs the crowd came forward to embrace her, she felt, for the first time, that she had truly been accepted.\nShe still thinks back to the people and events of her past, but no longer finds her lack of scars to be a handicap. Rather, she is happy to share the origins of her 'tooth marks,' and to carry on the tradition of her people in her new home.\n\nMedical checks revealed nothing of particular note. We suspect that painting these 'tooth marks' with mineral paints may have something to do with how external trauma leaves no mark on her skin, but no firm conclusions have been reached for now.\n- Warfarin, Medical Department",

In order to oppose the Lord Ameer, the chief traveled to numerous other tribes to build alliances, taking Kestrel along with her. In her free time, she discussed with the young Kestrel what kinds of body paint looked best, and gave Kestrel 'tooth marks' symbolizing 'Protection.'\nKestrel learned that the chief preferred white for 'tooth marks'.\nIn subsequent years, she used the 'tooth mark' that her mentor gave her, in her favorite color, while fighting a hopeless war against the Lord Ameer's soldiers with the few comrades she had left, until she was the only one left.",

At their request, she agreed to teach them to use a blade in order to take revenge for their families.\nHowever, she had underestimated the price of revenge. Witnessing the deaths of those children led her to look back on the purpose she had pursued for so many years, and the results that came of it. No longer obsessed with vengeance, she turned her sights back to the original connotations of 'Protection,' and began to see inciting revenge as an evil.\nShe came to the conclusion that her current life matters more, and that Rhodes Island is her new home that she must protect. As such, she has requested a reassignment to the Sargonian branch to participate in field missions.\nWe must inform the Sargonian office ahead of time to keep an eye on Kestrel's condition in the field, investigate any faction that has a history with her, and require her to regularly return to HQ for psychological evaluation and Oripathy monitoring.\n\nKestrel still has many mysteries, as there are details in her personal history that can no longer be verified, and her own account is sometimes confused or fragmented.

The fire rages on, and even when the skies open up, the rain can't even touch the flames before it steams away midair, leaving only the sound of crackling.\nBreaking the silence, someone asks Kestrel. 'Boss, how many did you kill today?'\n'Can't remember.'\n'Who would remember after the heat of battle how many they killed, youngster?' a weary voice adds. 'To survive is already a job well done.'\nKestrel lets the topic lapse, but that twisted face comes to mind. The one of an 'old acquaintance' scared shitless. The one she closed in on with every step. The one with no alternative but to jump from the roof. The one who left her only that face, one moment before melting into the sea of flames.\nShe knew who that was. The assassin who murdered her friend.\n'Still, this victory's worth celebrating. Today, we wiped out a few more of the killers who slaughtered our people.' Kestrel comes to a stop, looks back, sees the descendants she's brought along. The distant flames flicker in her eyes.\nThey raise a cheer, but Kestrel doesn't smile.\n'So how many killers to go?' asks again the one who broke the silence.\nKestrel gazes over. It's a girl, still young. If the tribe still was, she would never be part of these fighters. She would be living her youth, a bright one, a happy one.\nOh. That's right. She doesn't even have a 'tooth mark'.\n'You showed a great display today. I've now decided you should be rewarded with a 'tooth mark.' Kestrel fails to directly answer the girl's question. 'While we return, you can think about what style of mark you'd like.'\n'Really?'\nA feeling hits Kestrel. She's had this conversation. She was the girl before her. She, the girl, before the tribe's chief, the one who raised her—the one who was dearest to her, the one who outlined, over her left shoulder, the very first band of her 'tooth mark'.\nKestrel can't help but hug that shoulder tight, the warm memory almost abating the cold rainy eve, but it's only a moment before she comes to. For they, stood in the rain, are waiting for her.\n'Really—now let's get back to the gathering point quick. I'll find the box, and then you'll be able to choose.'\nThe group begins to slowly move, their figures gradually melting into the dark of night, never to be seen again.",
