Once she was free of her hometown, she began to realize the degree to which she had been shackled by aristocratic dogma. Little by little, Breeze began to experience what life truly was.

Breeze does not rely too much on Originium Arts, nor does she rely too much on pharmacology or equipment. On the contrary, she does what she can on the fringes of the art, making especially good use of herbal medicines. She can often be seen out in the fields picking herbs with a big smile on her face, making her famous in many towns and villages.

But now, we know the address of your workplace. \nHappy birthday, my dear Grace. \nInside this package is my present to you, a toolbag. \nWhen I was young, I always wanted to venture far away, so I asked a famous craftsman in Londinium to make this toolbag. It's very durable, and can hold a lot of things. \nBut after that, I returned to the life that my parents planned out for me, so I never had a chance to use it. \nEven though this world has many ways of stopping a person in her tracks, I believe that you can go further than me. \nYour father is very disappointed in himself. He wants to go to Rhodes Island to look for you, but doesn't know how to face you, nor does he know how to deal with what would come next. If you ever see him, I hope you two can sit down and talk things through. \nMy daughter, no matter what happens, I will always support your decisions and your dreams. \nIf Henry disagrees with you, then I'll talk him into it. \nOne last thing: Your father found someone to make a whole bunch of those sweets you used to love as a kid, even though he was also the one who forbade you from having them... If they show up in the mail, don't eat them all at once! \n \n––Beatrix Arizona \n \n \nGrace, I made a trip to Rhodes Island. Your coworker said you were out in the field, in some dangerous place no less. Something about being a battlefield medic for Rhodes Island. \nThe way I understand things is, Rhodes Island might be one of the best places in this world, but if you stay here, you should behave like a patient rather than running amok like you are now. \nWe can afford the cost of your treatment, but we can't afford to lose you a second time. \nI've brought you some food and supplies. Some of it's perishable, so don't forget to eat it. \nIf you ever need anything, just let me know. \nBeatrix wants me to sit down and have a good talk with you, so I'll come back next month. \nAlso, your mother wants to hear back from you more often. \nThe desk drawer in your dorm was broken, so I repaired it. Try not to stuff too many things in there. \n\n––Henry Arizona",
