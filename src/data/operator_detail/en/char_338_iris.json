When we took it on, we also arranged for Iris and Rosmontis to meet. It seemed this was the first time she'd met with such a situation while delivering items, and when she saw Rosmontis, Iris spilled with sorrow and a sense of loss. After first contact, however, she began to narrate to Rosmontis a fairytale from Victoria, doing her utmost to convey to Rosmontis the idea that 'Bluishsilver may not be with us any longer, but in the country of the fairies, she'll rest peacefully.' Though this wasn't enough to console an elite operator, or better said, Rosmontis herself didn't need such consoling, those words filled with kindness still had some purpose in the end—at least Iris could successfully convince, and console, herself. Not long after, their conversation then ended in a lighter place.\nWe still don't know just what kind of duty Iris shoulders, but out of respect for her, we have not asked her to disclose the details. Perhaps at a more fitting time, she'll pass this information on to the relevant Rhodes Island personnel.",

For those children receiving treatment aboard Rhodes Island, these times of carefree happiness deserve to be cherished. Outside of when a mission requires her, she's always around the children—she sings songs for them, tells them stories, gives them sweets. She favors spending time with them to the point that for a period, the Security Department's operators were skeptical of Iris's true intentions aboard. After conducting a meticulous investigation, they realized that Iris 'tried' no more than to ask the children if they had anything they'd be forced to give up before too long; perhaps this has some relation to her 'duty.' Most people who've lived in Victoria before have heard a fairytale that goes like this:\nGood children may enter a castle in their dreams, be welcomed by the castle's master, and have a merry time. When waking, about to leave the castle, they may choose to leave their own most precious belongings to the castle and make an agreement with its master, the agreement being something like this: at some precise time when they've grown up, they'll receive this gift from the castle's collection, from their childhood.\nAs for the details, Iris's conduct bears some similarities to this fairytale, but seeing as many parts of Victoria's own fairytales would pain the heart, we have no understanding of this fairytale's full picture, nor secure motive. It may be more appropriate to treat it as Iris's individual behavior for now.",

Each dream's contents are different, but their descriptions all share a magnificent moving castle with an amiable, patient Feline master, and a banquet to bring cheer. This story rooted in Victorian childhood is now sown throughout the hearts of the children of Rhodes Island. No suffering, no regret—all that is left is hopes for a beautiful life, and wishes for the future. Aside from the children, everyone knows who's doing it, but what's the matter with that? Children having distant hopes—is there anything wrong with it? I've already seen a child hand a treasure over to Iris, an ordinary and mundane wooden box, with a silk-wrapped sweet inside. A few days after, a lissom Cautus took that box away. Presumably, their safekeeping techniques are enough to store things without harm until the agreed day.\nI have plenty of misgivings, honestly. Would the children really remember this so many years later? A pretty dream? An amiable young miss? A treasure entrusted? At the least... in Bluishsilver's will, I hadn't seen any clause relating to that radio. Yet that doesn't prove that this agreement left behind was meaningless from the start. If she'd... actually received this 'gift,' surely she'd be so happy...\nFrom what I see, Iris is totally unused to this 'business' of hers, or perhaps she's only just taken over this hereditary sort of 'public service'—sorry, I can't find any other way of describing it. It's altruistic, there's no pay, you spend such an extreme amount of resources to do it. Probably, more than the children who take them up, Iris is the one who truly believes in fairytales.\nFor many, fairytale stories languish in the backs of their minds when they've grown up, but Iris? I can put it this way:\nShe's the one who makes fairytales real.",

Casting with full power, she could very well sink the most focused adult into slumber, but this level of casting takes a lot out of her, and she'll only use it while on missions. At other times, results are about as effective as a decent dose of long-release sleeping aids. She usually casts within cozy environments so that over a quarter of an hour, the target's mood will steadily settle, and they fall asleep safe and snug. After that, Iris may fully apply the most important part of her Originium Arts: operating dreamlands.\nThis ability can put off many people when they first hear it, since falling asleep and giving rise to a dreamland is one internalized expression of the unconscious mind, and if someone could mess around in it, to put it loosely, it wouldn't be much different from indirectly controlling someone.\nBut we believe Iris wouldn't do that—a conclusion we've come to after her arriving at Rhodes Island, and our interaction with her. She's never shown such inclinations in her nature, and going by our surface understanding, her duty and dignity wouldn't allow her to play wantonly with others' dreamlands.\nBesides, Miss Iris's so-called 'operating dreamlands' actually has some strict limits. She needs to have had prior contact, prior awareness and prior understanding before she can reconstruct key elements within dreamlands. Moreover, the everyday things Miss Iris comes into contact with are most, if not all, good and nice things. Even her most beloved fairytales—we know Victoria has many that would strike fear into people—are ones she only knows the revisions of, sanitized and upright editions, their contents portraying wonderlands that would never exist upon this world. Thus, what Miss Iris portrays to others likely are, and can only be, in such form.\nAs for why a castle, master and banquet are bound to appear in everyone's dreams?\nIf you may look at the attachments; one photo of Miss Iris herself casting, one of Miss Iris's estate—a small-scale nomadic castle—and one of its interior decoration. I invite any Operators able to recall their dreamlands' contents to compare with these.\nThe conclusion goes without saying.\n\n'I get it!

The instant he says it, he regrets it. But Iris isn't upset in the slightest, but instead conscientiously asks: 'Why is that?'\n'I heard a fairytale, growing up in Victoria. About a witch wandering the land, filching children's most precious things, locking them away in a castle in the woods... Of course, never to return. The collection fills the witch's empty heart, but the children carry their regret and resentment into adulthood.\nIt scared me like you wouldn't believe. All night I clutched the necklace my mother made for me for my birthday, a beautiful little pentagram. The witch never took that though. Instead, she took my mum, my dad, my entire village... Catastrophes from nowhere, flames of war that never went out... Miss Iris, there's no castle like you say, not in Victoria, not even in fairytales.'\nFinally, Joaquin asks: 'Miss Iris, did you leave anything of yours to the castle, when you were young?'\nIt's a difficult question to answer, and Joaquin knows it. It's like asking a magician if their head really does come off from their body. If little creatures really do come out of their hat. Those who create Dreamland exist detached outside of it, they don't believe in it. She could easily lie, of course, and tell you she believes.\n'It was the castle itself,' Iris says with almost no hesitation. 'I dreamt of it when I was quite young. It was grand, full of different rooms, each one filled with towering cupboards, all specially made. They could lock away time itself, and nothing would ever rot or fall apart inside... And because of that, I'd never lose anything beloved to me ever again. After I awoke, Grandmother made that castle I dreamt of into a pop-up book, and I kept it safe. Later on, she took me to the castle, and shockingly, it was exactly as both my dream and the book. And that book went into the very first shelf of the very first room. It was then that she asked me, you know, if I'd be willing to serve as the castle's master, and bring help to all the children.'\nJoaquin is sure Iris isn't lying; he's confident in his observations after being with Rhodes Island for so long. Even if what she says is so... unimaginable. She doesn't think herself a cheap conjurer—she *is* the creature in the magic trick, dwelling in the realm of fairytales. Joaquin supposes that's why the children aboard all trust her. As he speaks, his hands are still busy helping her stow away the sweetie boxes and toy models by size.\n'Sorry for bringing up something so pointless, Miss Iris.'\n'Your necklace there...'\nJoaquin looks down at the silver star nestled in his chest, now tarnished into an entirely different color over the years.\n'Mr. Joaquin, you are your own Castle.'"
