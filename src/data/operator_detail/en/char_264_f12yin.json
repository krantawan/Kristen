Even prior to his enlistment, Mountain's abilities more than satisfied our mid-to-high-difficulty missions' participation requirements.\nHowever, this was not enough for him.\nThis may be a result of how he personally sees his strength. To him, he still has a long way to go until he is truly strong, and having encountered all these formidable operators at Rhodes Island has only reinforced this thinking.\nOn the other hand, it may also have to do with his own objectives. He hasn't ever revealed his goal to anyone, but it is obvious he is working towards bringing it to fruition and that he needs to become even stronger in order to do so.\nSimply put, you might want to pay the training room a visit in the evenings if he isn't out on missions.

During our conversation, she didn't really display the kind of determination she had for her own actions that Kal'tsit said she had. It seems she has gone through quite a bit herself, though that doesn't change the fact there are certain things that I cannot tell her right now.\n Kal'tsit didn't agree to help them because she was convinced by Silence's honesty; there likely isn't anyone other than Amiya who could manage to do that.\n Kal'tsit agreed because Mountain is worth something to Rhodes Island. This is the biggest reason.\nNow, Kal'tsit didn't really tell me what he's worth, and my guess is she couldn't be bothered to tell me, but it isn't very hard to figure out what exactly it is. Mountain can cut open new paths, and through these new paths, we can get into places that we couldn't have otherwise. He might also be a trump card, especially one that can be used to negotiate with Rhine Lab.\nWell, saying this makes me feel like I'm a baddie... Whatever, only a few people have the clearance to read this anyway.\nTo tell the truth, though, if we don't have to, I'm not sure I'd want to get on Rhine Lab's bad side. Since we're working together, it's better to just stick with the status quo. I'm sure Kal'tsit doesn't want to cross them, either. Which means that while Mountain does have some utility in that sense, she probably isn't thinking of using him that way for the time being.\nThis also means that, to put it in less flattering terms, Mountain is just a refugee that Rhodes Island chose to take in.\nFeels kinda like it's more or less the same thing we always do.\nAfter all, we get a lot of folks with pretty messed up pasts. You could probably say what Mountain's been through was cute, compared to those guys. With traumatic pasts a dime a dozen here, what's the harm in taking him in?\nI'm not trying to be condescending or anything. He's a fine, young man, and he knows what's appropriate and not in all kinds of situations. Most young folks these days aren't sharp like that, tsk tsk.\nAnyway, I've had a little chat with him and everyone else who was involved in the jailbreak. To avoid attracting any unwanted attention, we'll keep everything that has to do with Rhine Lab and the jailbreak classified; anything else is fair game, though—Looking at the information I got afterwards, it looks like all the info about his jailbreak was suppressed, so I suppose all this hush-hush is working.\nHe also promised me that he'll at the very least let us know in advance if he ever decides to do anything against Rhine Lab, so I guess everyone's happy.\n——■■■",

If you're curious about prison life, you could do worse than asking him directly.\nHowever, it would be in our best interest to simply ignore the invitation he extended to the Doctor.\nThis isn't to say he was trying to deceive the Doctor. On the contrary, it was perhaps his way of showing sincerity to one whom he trusts.\nThat may be the case, but that is also exactly why we shouldn't take him seriously. It doesn't matter how powerful he used to be in prison. It doesn't change the fact that he was a felon.\nThe reason he said that was most likely because he had nothing to his name.\nHis family is still serving time elsewhere, and there is nothing he can do to get his revenge right now. He used to be a pampered rich kid, and now he has to go incognito at a pharma company after spending six years behind bars. He may seem very calm, but I can say for sure that this came as a huge shock to him.\nThe only thing that he has is probably the name he made for himself at Mansfield State Prison. His reputation there may just have been an illusion, but it is nonetheless something he built from the ground up himself.\nThis isn't to suggest he's too wrapped up in something that's not real. What I am trying to say is that every time he says that, he's actually making fun of himself as well as reminding himself that this, too, is part of his past.\nOf course, we cannot eliminate the possibility that Mountain will actually reclaim what is rightfully his one day and take over the prison out of nostalgia.

It likely also has to do with the fact his fierceness on the field hasn't changed how courteous he normally is—\nA person who's brutal on his enemies can still be likable to his friends and family. Once they realize that his graciousness isn't a mere social pretense, most would naturally come to understand that his ferocity and his friendliness are two sides of the same coin.\nHowever, it's likely that he isn't aware of this himself.\nAfter all, he himself claims that his composure, his calm, and his politeness are all just a mask, a facade. Yet there likely wasn't ever a facade; personalities are more complicated than that. His excuse is more like a kind of self-loathe towards his violent side, and he loathes this violent side of his because he strives to be even more calm and polite.\nSuppose he's actually wearing a mask as he says, though. If a person has been wearing a mask each and every day for decades, then who can say for sure that is actually a mask?\nOf course, we aren't trying to say there's anything wrong with Mountain; he isn't abandoning his violent ways as a means of rejecting them, after all. Yet there is perhaps an idea that he's going to need to learn during his time here in Rhodes Island: He needn't feel ashamed for this.\nAfter all, we all know that he never fights anyone undeserving of his rage.",

I once treated these chains and spikes as weapons.\nThey've hurt so many others in my name, and I in turn have received plenty of wounds of my own. But my fury never diminished, not even the slightest bit. All I could feel was it burning ever brighter, ever fiercer.\nUntil one time I awoke from being beaten into unconsciousness, and the doctor treating me said that she felt I was a very weak man.\nI thanked her from the bottom of my heart.\nSince that day, I began to show restraint. These chains and spikes were no longer used to harm others, but instead to defend myself, as well as those who could not defend themselves.\nI began to earn the respect of others, even gaining some small amount of freedom within that prison. But I was the only one who knew that my burning rage had not yet flickered out. It had simply stopped growing. It continued to torment me in the dead of night.\nHowever, it was only because of this that I felt I was able to walk forwards, and the meaning of these chains and spikes gradually changed once again, becoming the means I used to keep myself in check.\nAfterwards, these restraints of mine followed me to a pharmaceutical company. There, I still habitually wore them, but they had become nothing more than a set of work-out equipment. There were even people there who thought they looked stylish, and learned to make their own for fashion.\nIt was there that I spent an indescribably beautiful period of my life. However, once news of my parents' deaths reached my ears, a question arose in my heart: why had I decided to restrain myself all this time?\nWas it for that singular moment when I could finally release my rage without reservation? Or was it for a moment when I could finally let my hatred go?\nNow, with my parents dead, and those that framed them also dead, the suspicions on me have been washed clean as well.\nMy fury sputtered out, my hatred died down, and I was truly free.\nBut I was not happy. The moment the Hyde brothers died, I felt nothing, because I had no idea what to do with myself.\nHowever, once I felt the weight of these chains and spikes on my body, I suddenly came to realize—\nThese bindings are the price I paid for my freedom. They make me feel heavy, but at the same time, they make me feel alive.\nYes. I still yet live. I still have somewhere to return to. I still have things I must do.\n—A speech given by Mountain at his parents' funeral.",
