On the contrary, it is a normal reaction worth recording: real, natural and cruel. \n\nWaai Fu took Instructor Dobermann's hand. \nShe said that upon learning of Rhodes Island's experiment that demonstrated how everyday exposure does not facilitate the spread of Oripathy, all that remained for her to do was adapt. \n'It is not habit that controls a person, but prejudice.' \nOperator Waai Fu answered Instructor Dobermann's question intensely. \nInstructor Dobermann rarely shows emotion, but this time she came out beaming.",

If asked to describe Waai Fu in brief, most operators would probably describe her as a punisher of wrongdoing. \nWaai Fu is known to actively investigate the causes and effects of certain incidents. In some situations, such as disciplinary violations, she steps in to stop them at once. In others, such as outbursts of psychological issues some operators struggle with, she will focus on harm reduction. \n'If right and wrong were so easy to tell apart, nothing would ever go wrong.' \nOf course it's wrong to steal property from the Doctor's office. Please don't provoke Waai Fu again! Running in the corridors is dangerous! The medic operators are already overworked as it is! \n\nWaai Fu unquestionably fills a role Rhodes Island needs. Even though she considers her work here to be only 'part-time,' her effective performance and competent communication can be described as nothing short of excellent. \nWhen asked about herself, it is difficult to get Waai Fu to speak about anything other than her martial arts and the dark and messy detective office that recommended her to Rhodes Island, as well as her 'ordinary daily life.' She will disclose her personal career goals only on rare, formal occasions—— \n'I want to be the kind of person who can help people.' \nPerhaps... a bit too broad.",

This past month has been stellar, and I think we've all earned a nice meal. On me, as always! \nNow then, I have something to discuss, pertaining to the exchange agreement between Lungmen and Rhodes Island. The first round of applicant review falls on us. We do very important work here! \nEven those of you most familiar with Rhodes Island's regulations will sometimes get confused by some wording or something, right? I know there's one line, hm, it's pretty long in the original, but paraphrased—— \n'Should an operator fail to meet the needs of Rhodes Island, regardless of motivation or action, they are ineligible for onboarding. Conversely, should an operator appear with an origin or background subject to some scrutiny, as long as they meet our needs and strictly abide by our rules, they remain eligible...' \nSomething like that! The original text is very dry and very long, so I won't go over it all right now. \nDoes anyone feel the need to ask 'why?' Let me provide a simple example. \n\nSay there is some remarkable individual who comes highly recommended, with a remarkable set of personal ideals. In order to see their ideals realized, they sacrificed many people, destroyed entire cities, and ultimately succeeded. \nNo matter how great this individual or their ideals, Rhodes Island cannot accept them. We would be nothing but a platform for such a person. \nThen we have another individual, who has their share of problems. The things they do and the ways they do them may seem a bit unreasonable to us. This person submits a resume to Rhodes Island.—— \nSit down! I know you're all eager to say 'we already have a lot of operators like that!' And there are indeed some! \nThink for a minute how many things happen each and every day in the many cities of the world. Can we settle them all ourselves? \nWhen an operator subjectively plans an action that would harm Rhodes Island's ideas, that operator is immediately expelled. When an operator intentionally violates Rhodes Island's rules and regulations, that operator may be eliminated before they can cause material harm. \nEven if! Even if the regulations are as they are, Rhodes Island has never once done such a thing, we have never seen such an action. Oh, not counting private wire connections. You can blame Closure for those! \nThe adjudication of whether or not an operator is eligible is dependent on his will, not his rap sheet. \nRhodes Island has the ability to observe and study its operators while also maintaining its rules and regulations. At Rhodes Island, some operators are at last able to achieve what they'd always hoped to do. \nAs long as we maintain contact with them, we will respect their choices, within reason, and never force them to act against their own will. \nSometimes, when there remains no other choice, such a thing may come to pass. \nI hope everyone understands this, just as they understand the Infected, and Rhodes Island's mission statement. \n\nFor all candidates, the most important thing is to find them their place at Rhodes Island, and to acknowledge Rhodes Island. \nWe must adhere to this in processing the applicants under this exchange agreement. Understood? \nAh, of course, the Waai Fu girl we just approved is perfectly fine. \n'——When one is committed to constant reflection and tempering of his ideals, we are willing to serve as his forge. The bumps in this road, whether mine or yours... We will cross them together with our operators.' \nI hope you all appreciate this quote from Theresa. \n\n ——Record of ■■■'s lunch meeting.",

      "moduleName": "The Classic of Hung Mei Wing Chun",
      "desc": "The year she turned five, Waai Fu was taken to a study by her father. A few massive bookshelves filled the room totally full, all sorts of old books all over them, ancient records from all manner, ways and styles of martial arts. \n'Choose one, learn it. In three months, show it to me.' \nWaai Fu—still not able to read too many words—spent a while hesitating, then selected a book from the shelves caked in dust, with 'The Classic of Hung Mei Wing Chun' written on the cover. Waai Fu had no clue what kind of technique this was, or what characterized it. She simply thought it had a very nice name. \nHer father hadn't given her a single pointer, so Waai Fu had to pore over the books by herself. Yes, she didn't understand the words too well, but the phrases in there—'wicked walks vengeance heady; just employs mind and soul' and the like—flew completely over her head. But she still followed the movements in the pictures, practicing punch after punch, step after step. Assiduous, not allowing an inch of slack. \nThree months later, before her father, Waai Fu finished demonstrating the whole set of techniques, three-hundred-and-twenty-seven moves in all, flowing like nature, not a single one missed. But once her father finished watching, he furrowed his brows and sighed a rough sigh. \n'No. No good. Try again.' \nWaai Fu didn't know why, but had no alternative but to listen. \nOne year later, her father began to take Waai Fu through some simple fighting exercises. He clearly didn't give it much strength, but Waai Fu still found herself caught out again and again, and every time, her father's fists would never pull back as they landed on her. \nWaai Fu didn't understand. Clearly she knew every move by heart, but why couldn't she make fluent use of them? She decided to look within the manual again for answers, and after several times parsing from cover to cover, she finally found, in one unremarkable corner, a phrase. \n'Ways aloft may decree, but man is what makes change.' \nAnd a few more years later, Waai Fu could recite that book in her sleep, the tomes now shelved in a nook of her room, rarely flipped through anymore. In her training, too, her father came to chide her less and less, and she felt he was becoming less strict than he was before. But suddenly, her father left home. He left behind a pair of daggers, and a single phrase. \n'I must go and find something.' \nWaai Fu was unable to comprehend just what could be worth her father abandoning her, abandoning this home, to search for. It was only a few days after that Waai Fu left home too, to live somewhere different. \nWhile tidying her room, she again saw the manual, and offhandedly, flipped through it. From start to end, page by page, it was like her past lay before her. She found, at the very end of the very last tome, clearly written: 'Martiality asks mastery, this only from thorough training. With no purpose and no self, there is no boundary and no end.' \n'You're right, father. I'll catch up to you, and become stronger than you.'"
