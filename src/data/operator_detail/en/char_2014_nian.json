She tries to get people to play mahjong with her in the middle of work hours. Won't someone stop her?! \n-Yato, Rhodes Island Operator",

Few words are more appropriate when seeing her in front of the doors of the engineering department.\nNian will engross herself in discussing the similarities and differences between various materials with the engineers, participating in the design and experimentation of new alloys. Once structural issues are involved, she will often stay up with them for several days.\nAt least when she is among engineers, she is shielded from the words she hears far too often, 'unemployed folks sure have it easy.'\nWhen watching Nian debating fiercely with weapon designers over a blueprint, one might speculate that Nian simply is more accustomed to investing in her hobbies rather than pursuing regular work.\nHowever, when she was recommended by a Rhodes Island engineering officer, she refused the job offer.\nIt must be pointed out that Nian treats workers in the metallurgy industry more gently than she treats others. Generally, the only people who enjoy such treatment are the actors in one of the 'independent films' she's trying to produce.\nWhich raises the question, why?",

However, there was nothing playful about the nature of the support she offered to her teammates.\nNobody who sees Nian's fighting style will say that she's playing around. She is a force to be reckoned with upon the battlefield.\nShe never wears armor despite the fact that she serves as a heavy operator, and yet nobody has ever seen her get injured.\nTo explain this, Nian attributes her success to the special equipment she carries around.\nThe equipment functionally flows like water, capable of taking the form of a heavy shield or a strange sword. It is even capable of splitting into shards that can be dispersed across the battlefield, channeling some unknown technique to soften all kinds of blows that would have otherwise rained down upon teammates.\nAlthough Caster Operators have all come to the conclusion that there is little overlap between Nian's abilities and Originium Arts, that information is hardly relevant to her teammates.\nAs long as it works, anyone not just running logistics has little concern for how it works. That's right, even if Nian uses a massive sword to split apart a Metal Crab. Probably.\n\nUnder normal circumstances, engineer operators do not recommend trying to analyze or reverse-engineer Nian's equipment.\n'It's no good, we can't recreate it. It's best just to let her play around with it.'\nNian claimed to be a bit disappointed hearing this.\nOf course, Workshops #3 and #6 have been tirelessly working on it for the last three months, with their experiments incurring a massive amount of wasted resources.

      "desc": "At the border was a fellow of Li, who tilled. He dug up an idol, of more than a chi in length, formed like an armored soldier, vividly lifelike, but its nature was unknown. He gave it to his son, and his son loved it very much.\nThe fellow's son once carried the idol with him to the neighbor's boy to play, imitating an expedition. The idol was light yet sturdy, and all else that touched it fell afoul. The neighbor's boy brought out clay burial figures among others to serve as troops. None could withstand, and he was greatly angered, and abruptly took a hoe to the idol, whereupon the hoe broke and the idol was unharmed. The fellow's son treasured it all the more, always sure to place it by his pillow, thereafter falling asleep.\nThe neighbor's boy told his father of the idol. The father was covetous, and sought to rob it upon hearing of this, believing it to be valuable.\nOne day, upon the city docking in remote regions, the neighbor there entered the house of Li at night, seized the idol and left, to enter the city in his greed to offer it to a noble.\nBefore long, he met a person, who spake: 'To walk at night is very tiring. Rest for a brief while.' He did not answer. Again the person spake: 'The idol in your sack is an infant's toy. I bid you know this; it will not bring you reward, but instead suffer you calamity. You should return swiftly.'\nThe neighbor was greatly startled. He knew he had met an extraordinary one, and could not balk for a moment, only mumbling his assent. The extraordinary one knew his intent, and laughed grandly. The neighbor dared not raise his gaze out of fear. Shortly the laughter fell, but the extraordinary one had thus left.\nThough he feared calamity, he did not return, instead hurrying fast for the city, but the idol in his sack grew all the heavier, and shortly he could not carry it on his back, and dragged it. In an instant his strength was depleted, his mood in great turmoil. Fearful the extraordinary one would take the idol, he thus fell upon the sack, and as he looked all around he wept, and in the end could not abandon it.\nAt daybreak, a merchant passed by, and saw a man lying sound asleep. Before long, he awoke with a start, grasped the sack and spake: 'Do not take my idol!' But the sack was completely empty. The merchant believed him crazed, and left him behind. Thus he was in a daze, returned home, and there fell deathly sick.\nThe son woke, looked all over but could not find the idol, and wept greatly and did not stop. Told by some that the neighbor had thieved it, the fellow of Li sought to question the neighbor, but found him of grave illness, and instead made no question.\nThe townsfolk believed the idol inauspicious, and the son argued with them. And unsuccessful, was angered but spake no further of it. The fellow of Li, fearing his son would walk the neighbor's path in life, sought for it with great care. His son did not become crazed, but began to study forging and casting. Some asked the son of it, and he spake: 'I know the idol is not born of magic, it is the work of real man. I will cast a new idol to prevail over it.'\nThe son grew somewhat older, and forged and cast relentlessly, ingenious of mind and divine of spirit, and word of his reputation reached the capital. A department examined his talent, and weighed him well. He was selected to become a Tianshi.\nFive years later, the son cast an idol, and offered it to all at the Ministry of Works. This idol was fashioned after an armored soldier, clad and equipped full and well, of nature light yet sturdy, and did not rust even when aired to the sun or lashed by the rain. The High Minister was alarmed, and sought to ask of it, and the son told him of what happened in childhood. The High Minister fell silent and did not respond.\nThe son of Li lived to ninety and passed, and his marvelous skills have been passed down to countlessly many, and even now still have their employers.",

      "desc": "O Sui, o ye!\nIn lands so wide of life so rich, your birth was much to be beheld. What 'tween your scales came would do fall, and piled as mounts as you did journ. Thick green they grew and prostrated, to ye who sired their ranging lengths. Your words rang hard as mystic seas, your name on land as heavens high. All was your mastery to make, the crafts exquisite and profound, the natural realm would aid your might.\nAnd when you did relate with common man, there was no soul in Yan who'd not admire your character and moral gait, that mut so fearsome could be so humane, and not a soul would fail to call your name in praise for such pure kindness held, for where was such a beast as fine as ye! They speak of ye who cherished life and would not see it wanton smit, 'twas ye who soothed all into peace, made clouds and rain of it to bring Yan good portent, that you would scheme of strategy, would kill the others of your kind to see the land be gold in time. How selfless that you were, how giving to the end, our honor be!\n......\nSo when you passed away, the mounts and lakes joined too to mourn, the grass and grain did weep along, and all were moved by what a heart you bore; across it all did mists collect and wind in layers thick, the autumn gusts time and again blown with their baleful cold; they saw the clouds now and bemoaned that they could see no end, at river's rage they now bemoaned how stop it never would.\nSo once you passed away, and each incense stick burned to nil, and all my brethren parted thence, they left me here to guard your rest. All that you bid was failed and left adrift, and young and old all know this well. O wouldn't you regret this woe, for who would see such torment be? Soul such a wretch that hundredfold flesh still mayn't truly you return?\nO Sui o Sui, the seasons will memorialize, your deeds turned into song and dance, and what a ■■ing scene.\n......\nI further note. The True Lung told me this: While you remain in here, I cannot freely roam. The deadline of a hundred years, that's come and gone, and I'm extremely bored, so here I take my leave to find a decent hotpot place.\n\n—Candle lit and door rapped thrice, the Sui Regulator Candleholders entered to find the guardian of the tomb absent. All anyone found was an inscription in the walls of the southeast corner, carved cuttingly deep. From the style and contents, it can be discerned that this was presumably left by her as an... obituary to Sui?",
