He paid no heed to the young operator who brought him the forms and water, and only gave the most basic responses to the HR manager's kind words. The one thing that caught his attention was the potted plant on a corner of the office table.\nThe HR operator who welcomed him described the scene as such: Verdant's eyes visibly softened when he saw the plant, and he started muttering about the shapes of the leaves, surface evaporation rate, scent, and toxicity... most of it incomprehensible. Then, he bent forward, gently touched a leaf with his finger, quickly pulled back like he got an electric shock, and finally impassively asked the others where the plant came from. He was obviously suppressing his excitement as he spoke.\nHe rushed through the onboarding paperwork, then headed straight for Lena's greenhouse. If not for him, we wouldn't have known that the tiny little plant we got from her, which we often neglect, was such a special breed. I hope that he'll pass on our sincere gratitude to the evergreen Convalescent Garden.\n\n'Hey, come back! Get him back here! Look at how he filled out the form...'\n'Other than the code name, he just scribbled through all the other sections: occupation, place of birth, Infection status, reason for joining...'\n\nWe asked Verdant to redo his forms properly this time, and had him sign off that everything is accurate and truthful.\n—HR Supplemental Note 1\nThat snake signed his name as 'Strawman'! Good thing Lena was there to point it out. This time we took extra special measures to make sure that the signature is his own.\n—HR Supplemental Note 2",

Lately, an unremarkable herbaceous plant has become the center of attention amongst the botanists and gardeners on the ship. While appearing no different from your average roadside weed, it is apparently a new species unknown to any of the experts on the ship, and it was Verdant, the mysterious plant hunter, who brought it here.\nVerdant took out a small sample box from his backpack. I smelled fresh earth as he opened it, the lights inside the box still providing warmth for the plant inside. The unremarkable plant would have been removed from the fields just like any weed, fed to burdenbeasts, and eventually returned to the soil, had Verdant not discovered it, identified it as distinct from any known plant species, and saved it from its fate.\n'It may not have any special fragrance, or nutritional value, but it's new to me. And that's why it's precious.' Verdant showed unparalleled determination when talking about the plant, and his normally cold complexion visibly softened.\n\n[Audio Log]\n'You've been here at Rhodes Island for a while now. Maybe you could try letting your guard down, make a few friends... Say, I think Lena was looking for you. I wonder what it's about?'\n'Lena? The perfumer? Probably wants me to collect more thin-tailed grass.'\n'Oh yes, thin-tailed grass, that new species... interesting name. I wonder who named it.'\n'Yeah... who?'",

When there was anyone else in the library, he would put up a stoic face, pretend to have gotten the wrong door, and turn around to leave, only for his sigh to be plainly audible from the stairway.\nIt was later revealed that he had thought the library was only open to operators. But unable to suppress his curiosity, he snuck in at night to read anyway.\n'Going at night is the best way to get things done, whether it be retrieving half-eaten fruit from a beast den, taking flowers from a noble's garden, or browsing through the Royal Library's archives.'\nUpon learning the reason for Verdant's actions, he was issued a library card and invited to help organize the archives. It was during this process that he, who is usually reticent about his past, revealed a few fragments of his days studying botany in university. Through his talent and love for plants, he had quickly become the professors' favorite student, but he never finished his education. We can only hypothesize that Oripathy was the reason he dropped out of school.\n'It was the worst of times, but looking back on it, it was the best of times.\n'I made this strawman's clothes myself, after my school uniform. I wonder how my professor's project is going, and how the investigation on the growth cycle and distribution of those crops is progressing.'\n'It's good enough for me that I get to continue to study plants... but I wonder when I'll be able to go back to school.'",

He tried to teach us how to make these strawmen, but no one managed to pick it up. He told us that his father was a craftsman of some repute, from which he picked up these skills, while his knowledge of plants came from his farmer mother.\nHarboring an Infected made life difficult for the family, as farmers and procurers alike began to distance themselves. Even if his parents did not consider it a burden, they lacked the means to make any long-term plans for him. As such, Verdant decided to leave behind the warmth and comfort of home.\nIn his travels, he met someone who needed a botanist, and began working as a 'plant hunter,' operating in the gray zone between government, the nobles, and corporations, sometimes resorting to less than scrupulous means and getting into trouble for it. Because of his Infection, he is reserved and cautious when dealing with others, acting cold and aloof in front of strangers in order to keep them at arm's length. We believe that these experiences are the reason he avoids personal interaction.\nHaving spent a considerable amount of time in treatment at Rhodes Island, we have observed his interactions with other operators and realized that there is a lot of warmth in his heart. He regularly helps Lena clean up fallen leaves in the Convalescent Garden, writes letters of appreciation to Flamebringer for helping care for the plants he is studying, and brings back flower samples for Podenco and Lisa after 'hunting' trips. We are happy that he is beginning to open up to us, and that he feels at home at Rhodes Island.",

      "desc": "Verdant only manages a single step before a vine thicker than his arm bursts out from the bushes, lunging straight for his waist. The guide by his side tosses a spear, and as if conscious, the vine shrinks back into the tangle.\n'How do they grow so thick?!'\nThe guide scratches his head. 'That's just how they are. You're only here because you were after them, right? How could you not know?'\n'Suppose my boss was lying by omission then,' Verdant sighs. 'He said, there's carnivorous plants snapping about in the depths of the Acahuallan jungle. Keep one indoors, sorts out your Originium slug problem just like that. The big new thing amongst the Victorian gentry, he was betting...'\nThe guide only half-comprehends. All he can really think to ask is 'Do you still want one, then?'\nVerdant clutches his head in his hands. 'Just give me a bit to think about it. He'll be right storming if I don't get a sample, but I want to make sure I save my own <i>life</i> first.'\n'Huh? Save your life? Didn't you tell us you could take on five of our tribe's warriors before we left? Five of us could handle that thing no problem. You think the chief'd let me come here alone with you otherwise?'\n'Well... listen, just think of it as the terms of the job...'\nAt that moment, a vine silently ensnares the guide's ankle, and tugs him away for the undergrowth. Verdant hastily grabs hold of his hand, but the vine's stronger than he expects—so strong, he feels like his shoes are practically plowing the soil under him.\nHe curses his boss in his head, then with his free hand, switches out the vial on his saw, points at the guide's ankle and pulls the trigger. Out bursts a chemical spray, and in no time, the vine around his leg, and the entire thicket, have all withered yellow.\nThe guide springs back up from the ground. 'Brother, thank you! I don't know what to even say—we can pluck that thing and bring it back now!'\n'No, forget it. That was my strongest defoliant I just sprayed—the whole plant's on the way out. Not much point even picking it now.'\n'That's fine, there's always next time! With your wonder drugs, next time we'll get it for sure!'\n'Um, right.'\n'Let me tell you, people who can't back up their words are the kind our tribe hates most, and until just now, I thought you were sketchy as hell, but you did that thing in one go! Now I believe you—you CAN take five at once!'\n'W-Well, yeah, sure I can.'\n'I've got to tell the whole tribe when we get back how you're—you're this!' The guide throws Verdant a thumbs up. 'I bet people'll want to wrestle you, but you'll be fine! Just give 'em a puff of that drug and they'll soften right up, then even a little runt like you can flick 'em over, hahahaha!'\nUnprepared for the guide to start chattering away, Verdant blushes and quietly listens, picturing the proud Tiacauh coming to challenge him one after another. A helpless chill runs down his spine.\nBut compared to heading back and coping with his boss's thunderous temper... maybe this isn't so bad, he suddenly thinks.\nSo tonight he'll drop the pretense, eat and drink merrily, and prepare to get thrashed a couple dozen times.",
