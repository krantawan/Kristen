Although she mainly uses a crossbow for a weapon, even an object as seemingly benign as a pen, a book, or a rope can become a lethal weapon in her hands. Moreover, unlike an ordinary person, she doesn't value her own life or well-being. In various exercises, her methods of attack are often unpredictable. However, these methods often come at considerable cost to herself.\nPerhaps Schwarz does not have as much experience in dealing with monsters as other operators do, but she is uniquely capable among Rhodes Island operators at dealing with human and humanoid foes. In the words of one operator, 'She is like a machine designed specifically to ruthlessly kill humans.'\nHowever, in the presence of Ceylon, she may still be cold, but she betrays a softer side. Her relationship with Ceylon is less a simple master-servant relationship, and more of a relationship between sisters on equal-footing. She dotes heavily upon her younger sister and will satisfy any of her requests, no matter how unreasonable. She shows tolerance even for her most whimsical notions, and her normally cold voice possesses a certain pampering tone.\nIt is only in these moments that she appears to transform from a machine to a person, in the eyes of spectators. It is because of this side of her that many operators who used to fear her have been gradually changing their opinion.",

However, during the event, she chose to stand on the other side. Though she was forgiven, this has still ultimately been taken as a betrayal, and has caused a chain reaction of events.\nIn the analysis of the incident, we can see that the real reason she took the other side was because that she has an inclination toward the city's Mayor, Herman. It is true that she deeply loves Ceylon, but she is not just her puppet. Theoretically, as the mayor's agent, she ought to be the one who understands him the most. Her quote, 'When it's time to shed blood, do not send Lady Ceylon to do it, send someone who lives amongst the shadows,' is likely an accurate representation of her mentality on this.\nDespite bearing witness to the event, after joining Rhodes Island, Ceylon has still shown some idealistic tendencies. This is normal. She witnessed some of the cruelty that this world is capable of, but the relatively neat resolution to this incident has lightened some of the shock of it. Moreover, not everyone needs to have a deep understanding of this so-called cruel reality.\nHowever, this brings us to the salient point of this discussion: What position should Rhodes Island take on this issue?\nPeople like Ceylon are not a minority in Rhodes Island. Rhodes Island is not purely a research institution and thus our nature determines that we will sometimes come face-to-face with unsavory situations. Do we have an obligation or necessity to expose these members to cruelties they've never experienced before? Or is it enough to abide by Schwarz's quote and 'Send someone who lives amongst the shadows?'\nThis is a topic worth discussing in more detail.\n——Archivist R.F.",

Especially when the people I kill are my enemies.\nAs for how I specifically wiped out that entire clan all by myself, you don't want to know, Doctor. Actually, aside from giving you a detailed description of the bushes and shrubs I hid in, there isn't much I can tell you. Wait, and then attack - it really is that simple.\nI was born into a family of Rim Billiton merchants. Both of my parents were traders. When I was six years old, they were involved in a deal in which they were tricked into collecting a number of Originium Stones disguised as ordinary gems. I was infected with Oripathy when I stole some of these stones to play with them.\nAfter my parents found out, they went to confront those who had tricked them, but were ambushed and killed en route. I was treated like a slave and sold. In the end, I was selected by a mercenary unit to become their newest member.\nIn addition to carrying out war operations, this mercenary unit was also responsible for carrying out tasks for important men, mostly their dirty work. After I passed their training, I became a child assassin. After several missions, my organization was tasked with staging some accidents' in a certain city.\nThat is where my fate changed.\nMy task was to assassinate Lady Ceylon's father, but in the process of getting close to him, he subdued me. You can't even imagine. He was a... Forget it, I won't even bring it up. In short, I helped him eliminate my entire mercenary unit. Afterward, I became part-housekeeper, part-bodyguard. That year, Lady Ceylon was three years old, and I was 12.\nActually, what Lady Ceylon doesn't know is that during those years I was a bodyguard, I also helped her father with other matters... Don't get me wrong, I was willing to. The person I care about most is Lady Ceylon but the person I respect the most was her father. That still hasn't changed after all this time.\n......That day, he called me back to Siesta and told me that he found my enemies. Before I set out, he asked me 'Are you sure you want to go? You can live a good life here, Schwarz.' Ultimately, I went, but not just for revenge, but also to make a clean break. Also, I knew that somebody was waiting for me.'\n——This story was related by the Doctor personally.

This is what is engraved into her very soul. It is the branding she would not be able to wash off even if she were to spend the rest of her life in the light.\nSo what we must understand is that her hopes for Ceylon may be hard to achieve, but they are not to be taken lightly. For it is only those who have experienced the darkness that understand just how deeply that coldness runs.\nThe only thing worth celebrating is that she recognizes this.\nOnly in this way, perhaps what she says will come true. That one day, the Doctor will be able to tame the evil within her. I hope that such a day will come.",

The instant he turns to look in the voice's direction, he finds a crossbow bolt embedded deep into the soil, a mere inch from his feet.\n'S—Save me!' His legs go limp, and he falls to the ground.\n'If you really want to save your own life, then return what you stole.' Schwarz is stood on the rooftop, looking down on him coldly.\n'Oripathy put me out of work everywhere! I'll starve to death if I don't eat any longer!' Schwarz's eyes seem to pierce through him, and in a flash, anger overtakes him. 'You're Infected too, aren't you! Why can't you just let me go?!'\nSchwarz is silent for a moment, then gives a faint sigh. 'Because this is the only way you get to keep living. Also, if you can't find work, you can come to Rhodes Island. Give it a shot.'\nThe man is startled for a spell the moment his anger abates, already beginning to feel rueful. 'Really?' he asks, out of disbelief.\nSchwarz doesn't reply. She simply turns and leaves. She knows colleagues of hers will be there to help deal with his case.\nCome to Rhodes Island. Colleagues. She's reminded of when she'd just joined Rhodes Island, on the heels of a clash with certain others after having almost killed a target. It's almost hard for her to believe where she is now.\nRhodes Island's usual mission assignments are barely as complicated as she was braced for before she joined, but she hasn't missed people's whispers of what combat veterans like her have done before, and what they'll do again. She knows why she doesn't fall in their ranks—she joined Rhodes Island accompanying Lady Ceylon, and not out of any sort of personal belief.\nThe thing is—\nShe stops. Looks back. And sure enough, a fellow coworker is comforting the dejected youngster.\nAn Infected.\nFor the longest time, Lady Ceylon's dedication to curing Schwarz's Oripathy never really clicked with her, because she never felt her life was that important, nor did she think Oripathy was that exceptional.\nBut once she came to Rhodes Island, she realized how in a certain sense, she was honestly lucky. She'd never been treated unfairly for her own disease.\nBut no doubt, she was an Infected too.\nShe used to always accompany Lady Ceylon as she fumed, wait until she'd calmed down, and then brew her a cup of black tea. Lately, she's realized she sort of gets Lady Ceylon now.\n'Schwarz, did you catch the thief?' Just as she's barraging a local with geology questions, Ceylon sees Schwarz has come back, and waves excitedly at her.\nShe nods, and is there by Ceylon's side in just a few short leaps.\n'Schwarz, I've just heard about a group of homeless Infected banding together to attack passersby. I know we're in the field right now and it's beyond the mission's scope—could I leave it to you?'\n'Milady.'\nIt crosses her mind. Maybe I can do a little more.",

Are you still not going to kill me?!' He struggles to get back up, his shouts aimed at the one behind him, but his trembling tone bares his panic.\n'I haven't told you to stop yet. Keep moving forward.'\nIt surprises him—the answer he expects comes not from behind him, but from above.\nHe strains to look up, and the woman who gives him so much cause for fear is standing upon a thick tree trunk, the shade covering most of her face, leaving only a mouth pressed into a straight line.\nKachunk.\nHe knows. That's the sound of her loading a bolt into the groove.\nMore and more, his heart pounds like a drum, drowning out all sound in the forest, just like the thought screaming in his head louder than anything else.\nI want to live.\nHis hands push against the mud, and he throws himself out of the hole to lurch hurriedly forward, deeper into the forest. But death is tailing him, and can't be shaken. The woman looses the bowstring, and the bolt flies skimming over his scalp, leaving a wound down to the skull.\n'Aaagggh—!' he cries wretchedly into the sky.\n'Why? Why do you have to kill me?' The question is howled in misery, clutching his unstaunchable wound.\n'You're going the wrong way. You're meant to head right,' the woman icily orders, not answering his question.\nHis gasps come rapidly as he drags his staggering body in the direction the woman instructs. Very soon, he feels himself sunk still in the mire, ankles bound in place by some powerful force. The more he tries to step out, the deeper he's trapped. The mud gradually reaches his waist, and extends up towards his stomach.\n'Just do me a kindness, please, I'm begging you. I don't want to die here,' he finally croaks, unable to stifle the pain, realizing the dire situation he's facing.\nThe woman is not one bit moved from observing his twisted, shame-ridden face, and simply watches him thrash endlessly against the mud.\n'Three years ago, you ordered a group of completely unprotected child workers into a mine to excavate Originium. The vein was active, and caused an explosion in the tunnel, collapsing it. Every one of them was buried underground.\n'You must have been thinking that with such a terrifying accident, the children weren't likely to be alive, so you gave up on any rescue, and let them die on their own.\n'But there was one child, a very tough one, who used a razor to dig a tunnel to the surface with his own bare hands.\n'He dug for seven hours, without pause...'\n'I don't understand! What does that have to do with me?!' the man shouts, now breaking down.\n'Nothing. It just came to mind—I had a razor too when I was young. The only difference is, I wasn't digging dirt with it.'\nShe crouches down, and continues.\n'...I was slitting throats.\n'But there's not much difference. No matter how we used them, in the end we both relied on razors to survive.\n'Sir. I take it you're dead set on surviving too?'\nThe woman draws a hideously worn razor from her pocket, and throws it into the mire.\n'Then show me.'",
