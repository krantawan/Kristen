But one day, this Cautus visitor brought a Caprinae from Victoria who directly sought out Iris, chattered with her for more than an hour, and then applied to stay aboard just like Iris had. From her vexed, scheming expressions, it's plain to see that she's confident Rhodes Island is using some underhanded method to curtail Iris's freedom. After conducting an 'investigation' aboard that stretched out over two months, she found no evidence to support her view; our Cautus friend and Iris helped out in resolving this misunderstanding, and ultimately, she conceded her own failure of judgment. However, she did not return directly to Victoria, instead having the Cautus leave and then staying aboard along with Iris. The 'public' account is that she feels she should be of company to Iris until she fulfills her own responsibility, but the truth?\n'There are riches of toys in the playroom here, and plenty of people to play with. What's the harm in me staying for a while?' After finishing registering herself and becoming an interim Operator Caprinae—so Bena said.",

However, the way she gains trust is unlike Iris. To put it this way: Iris looks after the other children like an older sibling, while Bena plays together with the children, becoming one of them. With the help of her doll Annie, Bena is easily able to slip into the children's conversational circles, and is further able to put on an 'act' in front of others of her own volition, 'imitating' all sorts of personalities. If the Doctor hadn't punctured her 'act' the first time they met, she would be giving the Doctor a completely different character and tone of voice now.\nOwing to her consummate 'acting,' Bena is often able to 'obtain' more belongings than Iris does. That said, she's not competing with Iris for anything, only treating this as a sort of work, something she must do. Bena is always willing to do more for the Castle's long-retired 'Granny'—this is one of the few things she will readily admit.\n\n'After Bena boarded, Iris's routine with that mysterious Cautus changed. Now she takes everything to Bena first, the two of them are alone for a bit, and then Iris comes out with the things again and hands them over. Why?

Just as we'd conjectured, she is the one in charge of the preservation technique for belongings, and through her handling, the lifespans of things sent to the Castle can far exceed the original limit of their existence. However, should anyone attempt to look into details of her technique, she will make use of every childlike technique to avoid talking about the particulars, including but not limited to: dour refusal, blank ignorance, instant lapse of memory, etc., etc. Thanks to her reactions being far too amusing for their own good, some go out of their way to raise this topic with her, but anyone Bena or Annie sees through will soon suffer the practical tomfoolery of a little Caprinae and her doll together. At this stage, one can put the Caprinae prankmaster out of their mind, because most of the time, the one putting plans into practice is the ordinarily quiet, unspeaking doll Annie.\n'I'm warning you, never, ever treat Annie as some ordinary doll. She—forgive me for using 'she' rather than 'it' to refer to Annie—she can speak, think, is capable of lone operation far from Bena, and aside from clear spherical joints and a notable gap in personality, fundamentally differs none from Bena at all. Moreover, though she's reserved with speech, her curiosity is exuberant. When not by Bena's side, she'll roam about Rhodes Island wherever on her own, and should she find something interesting, she'll stay there and quietly watch, saying nothing. People are frequently startled by Annie, and some inquisitive people will instruct Annie personally. At times, Annie will be so absorbed in observation that she'll forget to return to Bena's side, who as a master of sorts will scramble about Rhodes Island searching for her doll, then finally find her Annie nestled in some room focused on something all too keenly.'\n'I know the description above might not seem too frightening. That's because I've only written about how Annie ordinarily acts. If you antagonize her and Bena, Bena will tell Annie absolutely every last horrid idea off the top of her head, and Annie will then spend days, possibly even up to months, carrying these plans out on you without a break.'\n'Believe me, you don't want to try. In terms of build and potential to harm, she has Morte beat by miles.'\n—Independently compiled by a Rhodes Island archivist Operator",

We've heard that in the Castle is an age-old library, and Bena's childhood was, outside of completing what tasks her Granny gave her, spent in that library reading whatever books she wanted to. She had too solitary a life in the past, to the extent that when she discovered techniques in a book that could enable her to 'make' her own true friend, she threw all her time into it without hesitation, and the ultimate crystallization of these techniques is Annie herself. Not a single person in the Castle was surprised by the appearance of Annie; to them, 'everything in fairytales is possible,' yet she'd need an explanation if she were meeting anyone outside the Castle—\n'A doll' is the pretense Bena gives. Bena often needs to use Originium Arts and manual ability to protect Annie, and in this regard, there is no difference between her and a doll. That said, those who pay attention will note that the Caprinae and the doll's conversations seem more than anything to be another sort of 'act.' Both have long since understood the other's actions, they know the other's tastes, and making displays of communication is really just a way of relief during daily life, or to alleviate surrounding people's doubts and fears. That perspective is one reasoned through the lens of medical observation by the doctor that carries out Bena's scans. From it, we can infer that when Bena says Annie is 'another me,' she's not lying whatsoever.\n'We have queried the relevant Medical Department Operator with resulting testimony that the above speculation has no empirical evidence.

The child began to think.\nHe would like to mend the castle, and continue his life from before.\nBut after the witch was gone, suppose the castle were to fall apart again; whatever would he do?\n\nHe thought and thought, until finally a perfect wish came to him:\n—I want to take the castle with me, away from the forest.\n\nHence, the child set upon the journey of his—\nAnd behind him was his tiny little castle, which seemed to look very much like him, and which forever protected him.\n\n—The Child's Castle, selected from The Jeffreys Collection of Fairytales New and Old"
