Prior to her full recovery, owing to consideration for the operator's state of health, Rhodes Island did not immediately set up work for Wild Mane, which had the converse effect of seeming to depress her somewhat. However, Wild Mane showed great curiosity in her new place of residence, and in her days off would wander all over, finding things to do for herself.\nThe modification of 'Justice Knight' was one such result. After Wild Mane got to know the scope of Rhodes Island's Engineering Department research, she promptly showed interest in remodeling her 'pet,' 'Justice Knight,' who also constituted a member of Pinus Sylvestris. Brimming with expectations for the system upgrades and voice capability installation, Wild Mane visited every day to see how things were going, following the pace of things. Finally, a few days later, she watched her Justice who only made 'di-di' noises for the longest time say her very first greeting—\n'Di-di, thank you to all at the Rhodes Island Engineering Department. Master? You want Justice Knight to say something to you...? May Justice Knight tell the truth? Burgers are very unhealthy. Please don't order that many again. Also, please don't throw your dirty clothes on the floor, and when you're holding Justice Knight to air grievances or declare your fighting spirit, please don't get too worked up. Your movement to tears or the sound level of your indignation renders Justice Knight unable to correctly receive information and execute analysis and response...'\nAccording to descriptions from those working at the time, Wild Mane seemed to take a massive blow, and was unwilling to set foot in the Engineering Department again until final upgrades were completed. It was only the day Justice commenced regular operation, delivering her first portion of takeout from the cafeteria, that things began to improve.",

Within the Krukowskas, Iwona is the most robust of her generation, her temperament the boldest. Thus, she had high hopes placed on her by her family, and trained since youth to become a campaign knight. However, the young, unwary Iwona caught Oripathy while training in the countryside, which threw off the path of her life. Raised for campaign knighthood, she held hope for a time, but couldn't imagine her family would immediately renounce her after she recovered.\nDespite her family's ruthless action causing her great disappointment, Iwona still resolved to press onwards. She would regain her spirits in her firm life's creed: as long as you're alive, you have to keep looking for a path to run. Iwona is a kind fighter, her passion and hot-bloodedness in battle innate to her, and becoming an Infected couldn't change that one bit. And so, she chose to become a competition knight, to achieve a knight's identity another way, to prove it for all those who'd been disappointed her to see.\nSpeed and technique are Iwona's advantages, and she puts them to nimble use, needing no theory of skill, able to respond to any move with nothing but her outstanding powers of reaction and observation, checking the opponent in one blow. Of course, combat tactics like this are a good fit to Iwona's own bodily makeup. Though the adulation of absolute power brought a sense of pressure, Iwona has inherited the family genes, along with a not-particularly-tall stature—fortunately, she keeps on growing.\n'Huh? You mean I'm a—I'm a centimeter shorter than Sona...? That's gotta be wrong, has to be. Wait, come back! We gotta measure again!'\n......\n'Miss Wild Mane, this is already your fourth time measuring...'\n'Dammit, just this one last centimeter...'\n'Wild Mane?'\n'...*sigh* I get it, alright. You fill in your numbers. C'mon, Justice, help me figure out how to order some evap milk later...'",

Perhaps deep inside, Wild Mane knew her own fated lot in life as an Infected. But in order to prove her strength, she chose to ignore these questions others would consider important, and selflessly threw herself into the battles of the underground arena. In this way, Wild Mane Knight 'numbed' herself with unbroken victory, in a perpetual search for the value in surviving. However, when she finally entered an official arena, she was mocked and ridiculed by other competition knights in the lounge, and her anger gave rise to an intense conflict. It was Flametail and Ashlock who extricated her from that incident. Following her entry into Pinus Sylvestris Knightclub, she began to face her status as an Infected head-on, and approved wholeheartedly of what Flametail herself was busy doing for the Infected. To Wild Mane, having a clear objective made it a lot easier on her. So long as it was 'physical work,' she wouldn't shy from taking it on, no matter how dangerous or troublesome. And yet, the significance behind considering her actions gave her a headache. Whether the social happenings that all the booky types talked about, or the sense emblematized by her own conduct, the old Wild Mane chose to let it go in one ear and out the other. But once she'd left Kazimierz, separating from her knight identity, what new course she should take as an Infected was now, as things stood, a core question she had no way of avoiding.\nAt the very least, Wild Mane is satisfied with her current life. One certain day, she got a letter from Kazimierz, her family seemingly wanting to pass a message onto her. She only skimmed through it once, on break while training with Ashlock at the grounds, and then got back into serious training mode without any fanfare. Afterwards, when asked if anything happened, she just shrugged.\n'They sent me a formal apology. Want me to give 'em a reply, let 'em know if I'm doing fine these days. Hah, I bet they saw their surname on the TV, finally remembered I existed, huh?'\n'So, Miss Wild Mane, how do you feel right now...'\n'What, me? I'm fine. Honestly, I got outta the whole shadow of my past ages ago. And all of them, living in Kazimierz—these guys related to me, whether they still wanna wallow in their mud clenching their own—pride and prejudice, it's got nothing to do with me. I sure didn't ask for their help again I got shoved outta the door, hahah.'",

Flametail is its leader, someone worth giving her own loyalty, worth running here and there to risk her life for. Ashlock is Wild Mane's drinking buddy, and a like-minded partner too. Through the two of them confiding in each other, Wild Mane, notorious non-fan of thinking, often hits lightbulb moments, understanding a hell of a lot of arguments and facts otherwise obscured by all the words in them. Most of the time, Fartooth's a quiet one, the total opposite of Wild Mane's personality. Her cool and collected nature is precisely what Wild Mane lacks, and any cooperation with her goes smooth as can be. 'Justice Knight' is Wild Mane's 'pet,' but more so her brilliant sidekick, with no shortage of times she's come through on the battlefield at just the right moment. Wild Mane at present is looking for her own way, too, hoping the new life she experiences at Rhodes Island will find her a fresh direction. Wild Mane and the other members of Pinus Sylvestris need only be together, and they'll surely be able to accomplish much in this world.\nEven now, Wild Mane still keeps up with her former schedule as a 'knight,' each day persistently training, honing her skills. There will come a day when her power can help people, can play a role in saving lives, and for the sake of this future, for bringing hope to more Infected, Wild Mane never misses a beat.\nThere's some selfishness to it too, of course. The first time Wild Mane met the Radiant Knight, she promptly requested a duel. Even though to anyone else it was just an impolite slip of the tongue, Wild Mane was completely, sincerely prepared for it. Until the day her legs are mighty enough, sufficient to earn the Radiant Knight's approval, she'll look forward, eager, to the honoring of that appointed time.",

No child at that point in the Krukowska family was as gallant as her, and she became the knight they placed their hopes in.\nIwona was used to long-term life in the camp. Scarce on modern means of entertainment, she upheld the strictest work-rest cycle and physical training, all of it for one purpose, becoming a campaign knight—the bravest campaign knight of them all.\nTo the Krukowska family, attaining service as a campaign knight is the highest honor of them all. The ancient family defends at the borderlands, their backs to the prosperous clamor of Kazimierz's cities, facing the frostbitten winters of Ursus. Iwona grew up on stories of heroism, and grew a pure fear and longing for that dangerous, tumultuous battlefield like nothing else.\nThe day her family Knight Primus granted her the chalice, it ensured Iwona had no second thoughts. She beat pure hot blood with every pulse. She signed up to every arduous training regimen with no care for the risk, and improved herself through it. She never took notice of whatever grimy deals and nonsense slander laid behind those majestic ideals. She...\nShe ran too fast, forgot precautions were always called for in perilous circumstances, and just one negligent second would be all it took to brew a tremendous tragedy.\nIwona only forgot this one thing. Just one time.\nShe was mercilessly thrown to the ground in the open country. A lone person hurrying, a lone person wounded, a lone person helpless. Those wild beasts growing Originium crystals wailed at her in their death throes, piercing her eardrums. Those sharp Originium crystals, sent every way by the explosion, skewered a body that wouldn't move as she asked.\nMaking it on willpower until aid came running, Iwona was lucky to survive. But after that, she was thoroughly cut away from the life she used to live.\nThat chalice was placed in her display cabinet, separated by a glass door, and every time Iwona came home, she would wipe it clean.\nShe tried returning to her family afterwards, to at least see her own mother and father again one more time, go back into her room, take away some memories of hers—\nNot once more has she set foot through that heavy wooden door.",
