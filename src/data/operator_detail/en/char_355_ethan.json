This may explain his attachment to flavorful cuisine...\nEthan's favorite dish is the Triple Shank Nudescale Lizard, grilled in mushrooms and spices, and paired with a Lupo favorite Concord Wine... When presented with such a spread, he was more than happy to share everything he ever knew. \nOf course, when prompted to discuss his former associates, he dodged the issue witha series of jokes.

Some Savras have a natural ability to change color and blend in with their surroundings, and Ethan is particularly skilled in this respect. He is able to use Originium Arts to turn his skin the exact color of any object he touches. \nWhen Caster Operators have asked to study his Originium Arts in detail, Ethan has consistently made a rather direct reply: \n'NO! You want to write down what I can do? Then everybody will know! What am I supposed to do when the enemy figures it out?!'\nHowever, when a certain female Savra operator made the request, Ethan thought for a moment before putting the full power of his Originium Arts on display for us. \nWe need not go into the details. \nIn reality, not much thought needs to be put into Operator Ethan: the activation conditions for the full power of his Arts are quite demanding, and very difficult to study. \nAt present, the Casters theorize that Ethan's Originium Arts have a passive ability to perceive the differences between metals, minerals, plant and other materials, and then quickly adapt his body pigmentation to the color of the target environment. \nNaturally, rapid changes of color within a short period of time left a sort of chromatic aberration against the background environment, causing a blurring effect.

Ethan is not a terribly brave man, and he has shown some signs of weakness in battle more than once. Even when he wins, he still cuts a comical and somewhat sad, tramplike figure.

They use secret tunnels to move throughout the city, hiding just out of sight of the guards, using spraypaint to vent their dissatisfaction in the narrow alleyways. That is, until they are discovered, and they make a break for it, barely escaping, dripping with sweat, struggling to breathe. \nEthan was one of them. He couldn't fight, and he couldn't talk trash. His spraypaint was his only voice, its vibrant colors and striking characters screaming out the plight of the Infected for all to see and hear. And with his nigh-invisibility, getting away from those who would stop him was trivial. \nThe city's dark nights had become chaotic and unpredictable. \nBut Ethan didn't care. All he had to do was run away. He could even help the other Savras get away. No one was as good at escaping as them. They left no trace of their presence. \n'All you have to do is run.'

If your stuff runs the moment it hits the wall, then you're going nowhere no matter how good a paint-bender you are.\nThird, exaggerating your typography...\n......\nFinally, what your graffiti IS. You don't just wanna let off steam. That doesn't DO anything, whether it's paint on a wall or violence on a crowd. It's not art just to soil something. That's not the root of graffiti. You've got to express an attitude, pass on a message... don't get too extreme, but don't ever get wimpy.'\n—Speech by Ethan on a Rhodes Island graffiti art course\n\n'That camouflaging Savra screwed up our original plans.\nYou see graffiti in the slums all too often, it's like ringworms on dermatitis patients, popping up everywhere. A commonplace oddity. So when we planned the riot there, we thought of using graffiti to pass on intel, hiding in plain sight. That Savra did his street art all the time, so we got him in on it with our codes.\nIntel exchange went smoothly. Three different works on the barbershop wall at the crossroads, and we got our time, place and method confirmed—a bombing, to put a little color into this numbed city. Everything was smooth sailing. Final word-out, final graffiti, that Savra decided he'd sneak his own little 'danger, don't hang around here' shit in the corner. Lucky someone else noticed early, covered it in black, got hands on him. Recipient aside, only people who'd even look at that whistleblowing shit on the wall were those drifters on the ground floor. He got a sudden case of conscience, wanted to warn them. Ngong gau!\nYou know how it went after that. He used his color-changing and slipped out while the brothers on guard weren't watching. But you gotta understand, the Savra was usually the biggest wimp you ever saw. Ran away at the slightest trouble. We never thought he'd have the guts to turn himself in to the L.G.D.\n......'\n—Extracts from an L.G.D. transcript of a Reunion member interrogation during a riot incident, later forwarded to Rhodes Island as certain details pertained to Ethan"
