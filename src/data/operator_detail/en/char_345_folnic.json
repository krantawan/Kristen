But Folinic is special. After Kal'tsit gave her passing marks on her Medic Operator certification, Folinic asked her to give her something similar to a certificate of completion. After Kal'tsit accepted the request, Folinic took it and placed it in the most conspicuous location in her dorm. Over the course of Folinic's two years of study, Kal'tsit has been personally involved in every one of her course subjects and research projects. In fact, very few people can withstand that degree of academic pressure. Just imagine that one of the heads of Rhodes Island is paying close attention to your academic situation, asking about each of your exams and asking why you got certain questions wrong - yes, most people would find that terrifying. But not Folinic. Rather, she seems to be a naturally good student: earnest, meticulous, and attentive to detail.

But in fact, what most operators want from medics is just a convenient method to feel better, and not all operators have the luxury of emulating Folinic's lifestyle, namely getting up at 6 every morning and being in bed by 9, running around the deck for an hour every morning, then showering and eating before heading to work. Not to mention, Folinic also doesn't touch tobacco or alcohol, doesn't party, only socializes as necessary, and spends the rest of her time in a research lab, clinic, or library to improve herself. Only on weekends does she take a day to satisfy her interests in hunting. For most operators, such a spartan lifestyle is... out of the question. \nBut what is behind this borderline ascetic way of life? Does Folinic really do all this so that she can get a sound night of sleep? According to some operators who have worked with Folinic, 'her present must be kept busy to the brim, or she will relapse to the terrible events of the past.' Specifically, 'if she doesn't exhaust herself during the day, she won't be able to sleep at night. '",

Though she had an interest in hunting and was capable of conducting a hunt in the wild and returning safely, she still had too much to learn as a combat operator. After the Chernobog incident, Folinic made a request to Kal'tsit in hopes that she could make the preparations to transition into a combat operator as quickly as possible, or at least, that Kal'tsit would allow her to join the battlefield as a combat medic or provisional physician. After Folinic took her physical fitness evaluation, Kal'tsit agreed to her request and had Folinic join the reserve operator training camp, where she trained with the other reserve operators. After half a year, Folinic completed her preparatory training and officially joined Rhodes Island's outpost operation team. Folinic considered many ways she could offer her support; she could try to become a sniper, or she could balance her work as a medic and guard; but in the end, she decided to become a combat medic and continue to prioritize medical assistance. However, in her half-year of combat training, she realized that most medics were quite frail and had no combat capabilities once they lost the protection of their comrades. To overcome this, Folinic used her pharmacological knowledge to carefully formulate a number of reagents commonly found in readily-available drugs to treat external injuries. With minor modifications such as increasing the dosage or mixing in different compounds, these drugs could become potent toxins that could incapacitate targets in a very short time. She has stepped out onto the battlefield many times and incapacitated many enemies. We don't know how she feels about her new role as someone who is supposed to do no harm, but when she's facing an enemy, her anger is evident enough to anyone who sees her.",

            "storyText": "Folinic is from Ursus, but also carries with her an unabashed hatred of Ursus. Her anger and resentment are not directed at individuals, but rather at the vast political entity that is the 'Ursus Empire.' As a Feline living in Ursus, Folinic used to live under abhorrent conditions, so bad that all she could do was pursue a single full meal each day. After she followed her mother to Chernobog due to her job, Folinic naively thought that she was about to enjoy a better life. After all, her life was secure, she had met many people and among them, many were willing to reach out to her or teach her. Kal'tsit was one of those people. Subsequently, she said to her mother on just another ordinary day, 'I'll wait until you're back to cook dinner.' But on that day, everything disappeared - her family and her friends, all gone without a trace. Only Kal'tsit, her mentor and the woman who would effectively become her only relative, rescued her from peril and entrusted her to an ordinary family in Chernobog. From sparse evidence and clues, Folinic pieced together the real cause of her mother's death - Ursus. From that point on, she began to dig deeper, to learn, recognize, understand, and internalize every aspect of what kind of country Ursus is, and each bit of knowledge only further fanned the flames of her anger. Finally, right before Reunion made their move when Folinic was about to finish her studies, she met with Kal'tsit once more and expressed her desire to follow her. Even though Folinic was grateful towards her adoptive parents, she realized that she could never forgive the Ursus Empire to the point where she did not want to spend another second within its confines. Now, if she could call any place home, she would definitely say:\n'My home will always be wherever Dr. Kal'tsit is. '",

With her outfit all together and a thrice-over in the mirror, she took her papers and tools with her, off to what was now her position in the Rhodes Island Medical Department.\nIt was an uneventful day. She got seated at her workplace, met Atro and the rest of her colleagues, set up her itinerary, went to a meeting, ate lunch, wrangled all manner of IDs, confirmed the laboratory she'd be using, ate dinner, chatted with Professor Kal'tsit, and went to read in the library. That was it, sunup to sundown.\nHowever, a subtlety to Kal'tsit's actions weighed on her mind. When she looked at Folinic, her eyes seemed inadvertently drawn to her cravat. Folinic had met with Kal'tsit several times throughout the day, and almost every time she did that, as small as it was, to the point she'd thought she was wearing it wrong, and that was how Kal'tsit was opting to notify her. Yet when she got back to her dorm and stood in front of her mirror, she found the cravat still tied neat and tidily upon her chest.\nIf something was wrong, Professor Kal'tsit would've mentioned it on the spot, Folinic thought. She untied her cravat, then tied it once again.\nSo, what exactly was the issue?\nFolinic puzzled over it, and in short order took it off, only to put it back on slowly this time, once again remembering how her mother taught her to tie it—\nA choked gasp escaped her throat before she covered her mouth. Folinic was a very disciplined person, but at this very moment, she was losing control over herself.\nShe tried to hold back her voice, but managed only to sob in heavier, more broken fits, almost suffocating.\nEven standing up straight felt beyond her, and her hands could barely brace against the table before she fell to the ground, where she curled into a ball.\nRationale? Wisdom? What use were they?\nAching—weeping—these were all she had left.\nA pain that a single night could hardly quell.\nHow long must it take, until you finally move past losing family so close to you, and all the inexhaustible grief—how long until you finally forget?\n......\nAt dawn the next day, Folinic came to on the ice-cold floor. She wiped her tears dry, went to the bathroom, and ran a cold shower. As the bracing water struck her back, she planned in her head to open up more possibilities in her own work.\nJust before she left, she picked out a jet-black cravat for herself."
