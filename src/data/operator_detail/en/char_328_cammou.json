She had hired someone to retrofit the unmanned photography drone she keeps around her. Setting aside the cost of the retrofitting and repair, the technician had moved to work in another nomadic city, and the money she had on hand was not enough to support a venture to another city. Without her drone, not only did her planned shooting sessions fell through, but her living expenses over the coming weeks also became a significant issue. In order to earn a living, Click applied to become a video producer for a pharmaceutical, thinking that she'd make some quick money, find the technician, fix her drone, then continue with her online career. \nThe rest is history - she now stays at Rhodes Island. \nThe reason is actually very simple. The people here not only helped repair her drone, but even made a few technical upgrades that she never would've thought about before. Now, the drone is more sensitive, sturdier, and even comes with a small amount of firepower for self-defense purposes. Thus, after renewing her employment contract and adding some filming permission, Click stayed on Rhodes Island and became an operator.",

For this reason, after each video is finished, Click will attach highlights of roughly identical length, and in many cases, these highlights are even more popular than the original video. Of course, even all the preparation in the world cannot ensure that the video shoot goes smoothly. In the event that all her preparation is not enough to save her life, she has to resort to the one thing that can - herself, the one brave enough to face the storm.",

Relax, you're a professional, and fanservice comedy uploads like this are easy money. Just follow the script and it'll go great. Let's have fun with this collab!\n'...You know you're smiling kind of awkward?'\n2.

Uhh, why did you run away after you challenged her, though?\n'Let's try one more, and don't shake your legs this time, Click... no noises either!'\n3. Daytime - Training Room - Close-up - Click and Broca train together, then arm-wrestle\n'Three, two, one—go! You got this, Click! Do it! You don't have to win, what matters is how brave you were!\n'...Oh, shit, stopstopstop! Broca, when you win, don't lift her like a trophy! Oh my god, she's gone rigid!'\n4. Daytime - Library - Close-up - Click and Mountain read during a comfy afternoon\n'Okay, she's finally calming down, thank god we did this in a library...\n'Click, stay exactly like that, just do a little presentation to the camera? Comfy afternoon, tell us what you're reading?\n'...100 Ways to Die Suddenly?! ...Cut!!'\n5. Evening - Reception Room - Close-up - Click sits down with a phenomenal Kjerag entrepreneur to talk over a game of chess\n'Mr. SilverAsh, huge apologies for the delays to your shoot, we had some accidents... but we <i>are</i> rolling now, um, is there any reason you're standing out here? Then who's inside playing against Click?\n'...Tenzin?!'\n6. Evening - Rhodes Island corridor - Close-up - Click ■■■■■■ (paper torn here)\n'Cut, cut! Blaze, <i>what</i> is your deal? That's not how the script goes! ...I'm sorry, Click <i>just</i> discussed this with you? And I'm supposed to just stand there and shoot? Excuse me?\n'Click, I don't know if this means anything, but your eyes are red...\n'Do we <i>need</i> the window open, Blaze? What's the point of you carrying Click? Wait, did you just jump—\n'BLAGH!
