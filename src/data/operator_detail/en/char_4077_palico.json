During its creation, the Artisan exploited a variety of biomaterials native to Terra in ways never before imagined, e.g. using Metal Crab shells to reinforce cart structure, and installing a return-fire cannon that exclusively uses Originium Slugs as shells, leaving the operators of Engineering lost for words. The 'Felyne Offroader' was comprehensively put through its material paces by the Palico himself, being tested for applicability in various possible hunting scenarios including volcano, tundra, desert, and jungle settings, and was ultimately deemed to meet Felyne cart standards, and capable of being used to rescue the Doctor. Meanwhile, the Scholar took into account the 'Felyne Offroader's' development costs, and proposed that a third of its operation expenses be collected from the Doctor for every rescue as compensation, which received the Felynes' unanimous approval.\nOne question raised by an Engineering Operator—'why don't you install an Originium engine, instead of pushing it by hand?'—remains thoroughly unaddressed and forgotten by the Felynes.",
