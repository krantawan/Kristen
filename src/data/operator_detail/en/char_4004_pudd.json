Receiving Operator Pudding's resume was an unexpected blessing; after all, working under Closure requires not just rich theoretical knowledge and experience, but someone who can adapt to her numerous wild fantasies and make them happen with her. In the course of recruiting someone to be her electrical engineering assistant, Closure went through several rounds of filtering, ultimately personally selecting this young Columbian engineer, who sailed smoothly through the interviews and joined the Engineering Department.\nThis Operator, the first day she reported in, was promptly named 'Pudding' by Closure, and is now an indispensable electrical engineer for Rhodes Island. With Pudding's help, Closure redrew the complex, chaotic tangle of engineering prints into something leaner and cleaner, and after going through standard safety tests, put it into use. Having Pudding's assistance put Closure in a position to up the power transformers' efficiency by 12%, an enormous savings for Rhodes Island's energy consumption. Thus, for her excellent work ability and specialist accomplishments, Pudding earned an ample performance bonus in her first three months, prompting a grateful smile, followed up by—a request for a whole week off, cheerfully taking her first vacation.",

When she first arrived at Rhodes Island, she was hardly as lively as her cute appearance would suggest. After a physical examination, Pudding revealed the cause of her infection. While conducting an on-site survey and investigation in the country, because of her own lapse in attention, she came into direct contact with Originium matter and came away with lacerations, hence becoming an Infected. After this, she had a considerable mental aversion to surveys in the wild, and her desire to go outside decreased to a minimum. Originally wanting to continue her school studies, she turned away from higher education, instead planning a professional path to treat her illness.\nFortunately, the knowledge she gained from school and the efforts she herself made didn't go to waste. Under Closure's guidance, she quickly grasped the complexities of electrical engineering's modern technical applications, and gradually became more proficient through engineering blueprinting and base station planning.\nPudding's changed very quickly since coming to Rhodes Island, and after getting her bonus, she fully enjoyed a vacation trip to the tundra to experience a theme park for herself.",

According to her, it's a present her parents gave her when she was young, and she's always dearly cherished it. When straying far from home, Pillow becomes even more of a vessel of nostalgia. Thus, in Pudding's dormitory, at her workbench, and even in the recliner she rests in when working overtime for Engineering, there are spots exclusively for Pillow to go. See Pudding when she's eating in the cafeteria and you'll see Pillow sitting right in front of her, and she'll be cheerfully muttering away to Pillow the whole time... that comfortable yet unique atmosphere always makes operators hesitate before deciding not to ruin the carefree mood.\nPudding's grandfather migrated to Columbia long ago, but preserved his old way of life, meaning Pudding's taken sporadic trips to live in the frigid region of Sami since she can remember. It didn't just spur her love of skiing; apparently, the icy, snowy climate bolsters Pudding's energy, as though she's back in her true, most comfortable state. To be able to lead a better life, Pudding and her parents both chose to work in the city, in modern scientific and technological firms. But in times when she needs to relax, it seems the vast, uninhabited snowfields, the sharp rays of sunlight that reflect off the white, the noises in the wakes of frigid winds that blow through Sami's black forests, are the true home of her soul.",

It's because of this that Closure always seems to love giving Pudding a little 'extra' work to complete. Whether all-nightering research out of excitement on a new project, or needing to finish a rough design that came in a burst of inspiration, Pudding aids in the process of going from the creative and concept stages, working out implementation, all the way to the blueprints. Pudding isn't merely without complaint; she even actively stays overnight at Engineering, and as time's passed, she's gotten her own exclusive tent to rest in. After work, she'll wrap up in the tent bedding with Pillow and take a breather for a while. Unlike Closure's bolts from the blue, when you ask Pudding why she spends so much time in Engineering, she gives the simplest reasoning: since coming to Rhodes Island, she's gotten more chances to get into modern technical products and complex electrical engineering projects. Someone's got to be in charge of the fiddly, dull parts of work, and Pudding esteems researchers like Closure with all their experience, so she hopes she can use her own simple energies to ease the pressure of work off of everyone, thus letting them delve into even more refined scientific developments. It's no wonder the people of Engineering habitually take special care of Pudding, always leaving her workbench full of all sorts of snacks and desserts.\nAt the same time Pudding humbly expands her own knowledge and experience, Closure seems to have a particular eye for Pudding, calling her to serve as her assistant on all manner of experiments. Who knows if Closure sees something special in Pudding. She may be grooming her for bigger responsibilities in the future.",

The founding of trade enclaves represents the first time in a century the Sami have opened borders, Columbian caravans and corporate engineer teams becoming frequent guests at Sami's frontier. Ever since she was young, Pudding's frequently gone with her parents to Sami, headed for that ancient land. \nIce and snow blanket the earth wide, sunshine spilling over and refracting, as if a realm paved full with gems. But this is only one corner of Sami. \n'On the tundras of Sami far from civilization, in the forever hibernal Fjal Vetrtonn, most Sami by far still carry on their millennium-old ancient way of life. They're far removed from the Columbian enclave, indifferently surveying all from the Fjal Vetrtonn and bone-chilling winds. Time freezes upon their skin,' says the Sarkaz owner of the coffee shop. 'Don't you want to go deeper and see? See the sights of those tundras and mountains, how the Sami get along with nature in the wilderness.' \n'Am I allowed to?' Pudding hesitantly asks. 'I'm not sure if they'd welcome a city person like me...' \n'Sami does not defy its own fate. We know what it faces, and know how it will respond.' \nAnd so Pudding signs up to join a local supporting construction project, departing early morning one day, going with the team of Columbian engineers into the Myrkwood that she once only gazed at from afar. \nIn the primordial woods, the Sami steadfastly distance from modern technology. Only one subset, a wetland settlement near to the autonomous region, is willing to receive the Columbian engineers' help. \nConstructing a base station, connecting cables, turning on the village's first bulbs... Pudding stares at the faint lights, and the grin of satisfied wonderment on some Sami faces, and it suddenly hits her just what technology means to these people. \nBut it's only in places more remote still, where the true secrets of the Sami lie, a land the Columbians cannot pry into. \nPudding's vacation will be over very soon. She writes up her experiences in the village into a report, and puts it inside her suitcase, ready to take it back to Columbia. \nI'll come back again very soon, she thinks happily. \nYet because of one accident, this hope, ordinary by all rights, spends a long, long time delayed, before she can make good on it."
