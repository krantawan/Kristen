However, based upon the Operator Combat Assessment provided by the HR Department, we have learned that Tachanka exhibits extremely professional combat and tactical abilities. He has demonstrated impressive combat experience when it comes to positional warfare and defensive combat. We speculate that Tachanka has served in a regular army for many years, and may have participated in large-scale group operations many times.\nIn addition to his rich combat experience, Tachanka has clearly received comprehensive training as a mechanic.\nHowever, please note that the members of Team Rainbow are only working with us on a temporary basis and are not formal employees of Rhodes Island.

Rather, 'gun' would not be the correct way to describe this weapon. It is a weapon unlike anything we would call a 'gun.'\nUnfortunately, we were not able to personally witness the firing of this big guy. Though there isn't any usable ammunition left, Tachanka described to us in detail exactly how this ammunition works.\nWe've tried countless times to restore the weapons described by Tachanka to working condition, but the results of all our experiments have been unfortunate. In the first 100 samples, most of the ammunition lost all its lethality at a distance of 10 meters, but Tachanka said that this weapon is able to land hits at 600-700 meters. Is that really possible? What exactly is 'nitrocellulose?'\nAfter a week of attempts... a truly disastrous week, we broke a lot of things. Including this month's salary. However, it wasn't all for naught.\nClosure mixed some ground Originium powder with raw industrial ketones. After drying, this compound was able to yield ammunition with a range of about 200 meters. In order to fire this ammunition normally, we modified the bore and receiver of the heavy gun and replaced it with a large-caliber gun tube. After several further rounds of modification... at least we can say that we attained satisfactory results at last.\nTachanka was overjoyed, and the feeling was mutual. After all, half a month of grueling labor had finally bore fruit.\n\nThe only problem I have, however, is this... this piece of junk is cumbersome, noisy, and doesn't even pack as much firepower as Raythean's semi-automatic heavy ballista! What was the point of all that hard work?! If there's ever a next time for this kind of stuff, count me out!",
