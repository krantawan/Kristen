Furthermore... No! This is pissing me off!'\n'All that these 'Reunion' scoundrels are doing is getting revenge on society and making everyone even more afraid of the Infected!

They must immediately—'\n'Uhh... It's burning again.'\n'Right. Try it one more time.'\n\n'Finally, exiled Infected are extraordinarily likely to bear a grudge and seek opportunities for revenge against the city... Phew, I'm done, Professor. I'm not particularly fond of this justification, but they don't leave me much choice. We have to put it in terms that those stubborn, short-sighted blockheads can understand.'\nEthelflaed wrote fifteen whole pages with the neatest handwriting and not the slightest scorch mark. She looks excitedly toward her professor.\n'Good.' Angst nods and takes out a letter he had written. It is addressed to a 'Rhodes Island', a name she is unfamiliar with.\n'You know the theory. You have mastered the techniques. Your studies can finally begin.'\n'You want to solve both the Infected's problems and the 'Reunion' problem...
