While most people find the ill-natured Aak to be impossible to deal with, Hung is his natural nemesis. If a situation with Aak truly became unbearable, just report it to Hung, and the situation will soon be resolved. While it cannot be said that Aak fears Hung, Hung unabashedly treats Aak like a little brother; and Aak, despite his usual attitude, probably sees Hung as an older sibling as well.\nThe second is Waai Fu. Though the righteous Waai Fu and the ill-natured Aak would seem totally incompatible, the two have unexpectedly developed a good relationship as members of the same detective agency. Waai Fu believes that Aak is a fundamentally good person, whereas Aak sees Waai Fu as old-fashioned but not impossible to get along with. By the way, if Aak is out looking for trouble, you should call Waai Fu instead of Hung. The ensuing scene is quite entertaining.\nThe third is Warfarin. After learning that the true identity of 'Mr. Blood' was none other than Warfarin, even Aak, who had spurned mainstream medicine, couldn't help but to engage Warfarin in academic discussions on a frequent basis. Admittedly, Warfarin, whose views towards medicine differ slightly from other medics perhaps as a result of her longevity, and Aak, who is a bit of a freak himself, make an unexpectedly good duo. But as a caveat, when these two find out that they share some common interest and tastes, strange laughing and cheering have become far more prevalent than ever before - either from Warfarin's or Aak's lab, now with two voices instead of one.",

Not to mention, he frequently researches and develops medication that seems incomprehensible to the average person, such as pills that make farts smell like watermelon, or make people lose the ability to recognize a certain color.\nOf course, if you knew who his father is, this tendency is no longer so puzzling.\nAak's father used to be a well-known attending physician at the Lungmen Central Hospital and was renowned for his medical ethics. But due to a certain incident, he was framed by others for malpractice, after which his career plummeted and he disappeared from the public eye. The next time he reappeared, he had become a vicious illegal doctor in the underworld of Lungmen's black zone, with even Lungmen's gang bosses trembling at his feet. When this person perished a few years ago in a gang war, the entire Lungmen underworld breathed a collective sigh of relief.\nAak clearly inherited his father's mantle, both the good and the bad. Even as a teenager, he made a reputation for himself in the underworld. Without discipline, he perhaps would have walked down the same path as his father, eventually becoming feared as well. However, after meeting Hung, he joined Lee's Detective Agency, a move that can be considered a turning point in his life.",

Despite Aak's young age, his views towards medicine have already greatly surpassed that of even experienced doctors who have been immersed within the field for years.\nThe reason behind this is simple: because he left the mainstream medical circles, he no longer views medicine solely from the perspective of a pure doctor.\nPure doctors will think about problems within the scope of medical practice, preoccupied with how to better save people, often losing sleep or forgetting to eat in the process of developing new drugs. Most of Rhodes Island's medics fall under this category.\nHowever, Aak is different. He saw the limitation of medicine, and recognized that the existence of medicine was due to harm. Of course, a large proportion of this harm occurs naturally in the form of diseases, but because Aak grew up in the black zone, he saw more of the harm that people inflicted upon each other.\nOver time, he began to scoff at the idea of pure medicine, resenting his colleagues because they only knew how to save people. They would rush to the scene of a conflict, even the most advanced pharmaceuticals utterly powerless to stop the conflict from having broken out in the first place. The more lofty and prideful the medical profession, the more Aak came to hate it.\nOf course, Aak's thoughts are radical and fringe, with his daily behaviors reflecting a bit of his immaturity. Nevertheless, one cannot deny that his ideas are rooted in the bloody reality that shaped his upbringing, and events sometimes unfold in the way he describes. While Rhodes Island does pursue a lofty dream, it also never looks away from reality.\nAfter getting to really know him, several of Rhodes Island's core medic operators set aside their initial disgust towards him and, as his guardian Hung hoped for, decided to show him a better side of this world and provided him with the best possible conditions.\nAfter all, everyone knows that Aak is a genius, and over time, he will surely mature into a phenomenal doctor.",

But if you think about it, it's not that hard to understand.\nHe depreciated all medicine, and within that, saw himself as even lower - 'if medicine is useless, then is it not true that I, as a practitioner of medicine, is even more useless?' The greater his medical proficiency, the more he rejects himself; but if he tries to leave medicine behind, he loses his sense of purpose, and thus the vicious cycle continues.\nNo one told him that what he was doing was right, no one told him that it was fine to pursue that path, and nobody wanted to give him a place that would accept him. While it must be said that Lee's Detective Agency prevented his sense of morality from going too far astray, his psychological issue had not been resolved. Of course, this is not to place the blame upon the agency, for psychological problems usually require professional help even to be detected. Moreover, a personality like his also requires the proper environment.\nAnd at Rhodes Island, Aak is recognized and accepted for who he is. Everyone tells him that he is just, and reminds him that he is the best at what he does. As for the crux of the reason he resents medicine, Rhodes Island is already addressing the issue - we never intended to rely solely on pharmaceuticals to solve all the world's problems. He either will - or already has - found Rhodes Island to be a suitable place for him, and we will work hard as well to realize his ideals.",

Like all of that isn't just phony self-servicing junk.\nThe market ain't no peaceful place, but at least it ain't noise that cares about me. Besides, it's not like I'm a stranger to life here. Just reliving the good old days on the lam with the old sleazebag, am I right?\n'Thief! C-Catch him!'\nMan, every day they put on the same dull crap. I'll hand it to the tourist though, a guy with no strength in his right arm stealin' your bag's pretty hilarious. And hopeless.\nActually, check that out, I think the thief's a familiar face? That's the poor sucker who came to me for a detox in the middle of the night. He had his whole gang carryin' him around like a swollen eggplant hopped up on growth hormones.\nLooks like I went a little too easy on him. Man, I knew letting the poison wreck his left arm more would've been a good idea.\nI've said it before, medicine's not gonna stop harm at the source. If Hung thinks he's so smart...\n'*sob* Grampa...'\nYo, hassle just keeps findin' me. Don't you dare look my way.\n'D... Doctor? You have to save my grampa, he's my only family...\n'Save how? The old man's practically counting the days. Maybe someone can lay him in a nice sandalwood coffin, give him a decent exit. Either way, that someone ain't me.\nThink it was a night like this one too, just after the rain lifted. My pops was down for the count after takin' a stray bullet. He dragged me to hide in some street corner he found. Dude hoped I'd take on his mantle. Maybe relieve his pain, or... just straight up address it.\nThe way he went out was kinda ridiculous. Rememberin' how he loved to own the whole unlicensed doctor thing just makes it funnier.\n'*sob*...'\nScrew it, I gotta do somethin' to make this kid quit crying so ugly.\nWe'll take watermelon, lychee, and pineapple flavor, mix 'em up, squeeze out the bubbles, aaand... perfect, this med's gonna please the crowd like nothin' else.\nC'mon, old timer, give your grandkid some peace of mind. Lemme jab you up nice and good.\n'Huh? Grampa, are you awake? Grampa? Doctor, why is my grampa laughing so hard...? Grampa, stop laughing, you're gonna make me laugh too...'\nHey, a few side-effects comes with the territory. Also, never call me a doctor again, or I'll tell you straight to your face that even if he lasts the night, he—\nWhatever, <i>at least</i> he can last the night.\n......\n'Cooking skills won't stop starvation at the source either. Are you saying that's pointless too?'\nWeird. How come Hung preaching at me just flashed through my brain? Yeuch, guess I'm gettin' a little peckish, though...\nHuh? The kitchen lights are still on... dude, Hung, did you not go to bed yet?\n'Here, your midnight snack.\n'After you're done, wash the dishes, then put them back in the cupboard. They're good habits to learn.'\nThe hell? Here he goes again, educating people without asking.",
