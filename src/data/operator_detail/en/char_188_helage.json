Although Hellagur has never revealed his identity to anyone else, members of the Ursus Infected Underground have always regarded him as legendary. This has led all operators to take an interest in these rumors.\nOf course, as an Azazel infected, Hellagur himself has said that he is more adept at helping the clinic continue its operations rather than developing its medical technology, influence, and scale.\nIn fact, Hellagur does indeed guarantee Azazel's status. For many years, Azazel has been an important pillar of support for the Chernobog infected. Most of the local infected are grateful for Azazel's efforts.\nBut maintaining a benevolent, neutral stance cannot protect this clinic in times of political turmoil. After all, they are too influential. Whether by trying to remain neutral or actively trying to topple a certain party, they inevitably put either tangible or intangible pressure on one side or the other.\nIt would be better to say that being able to escape the Chernobog incident unscathed proves that Hellagur possesses acute foresight. Hellagur has his own opinions of the chain of events that might lead to the clinic's destruction, but said he is unable to divulge more information until more definitive evidence presents itself.\nAt least for now, Hellagur is mum about everything regarding Azazel.

Part of this hatred is derived from his desire to protect the clinic, and the other part is due to reasons unknown.\nThough Hellagur is by no means a defeatist, he still has taken a hardline attitude toward operations in the Ursus area.\nHowever, when analyzing the military power of Ursus, he has said 'No political entity should come into direct conflict with Ursus. Even if its corruption and fanaticism will eventually destroy it, it's still the most fearsome force in the land.'\nFrom this point of view it could be said that as an infected himself, Hellagur's opinions on many matters are far more critical than those of other infected.\nAll strategically-minded operators have their own thoughts on the situation, and they're all well aware of Rhodes Island's true circumstances in it. Hellagur's relationship with Ursus may make a small number of operators distrustful. But operators who attended the strategic meetings all understand Hellagur's true intentions.\n\nBut Hellagur's words contain no contradictions. He believes that as an infected, he is already on Ursus's opposing side -- \n\n'However, once Ursus looks at you, you will know the difference between being an enemy of Ursus, and Ursus regarding you as one.'",

His friend was the commander of the enemy army, the target of his mission, and was identified as a core figure in the enemy army by Ursus. \nThe second trauma was when a terrible battle broke out between him and the person he trusted the most. After the battle, he was still standing, but the fate of the other person is unknown, as if he died in some unknown alley somewhere.\n\nThe first time, his friend entrusted him with a blade called 'Kudarikiri,' and a young infected girl named Neon.\nThe second time, the person he trusted left him a black market clinic called 'Azazel,' as well as a conviction.\n\nHellagur knew his friend had plotted Ursus's defeat, but Hellagur would not blame him.\nHellagur knew that the child he trusted had instigated the entire betrayal and injured all of the infected in the clinic, but Hellagur would not hate this child.\n\nHe often refers to himself as a warrior. Perhaps this is because he doesn't know how to face everything Ursus has done to him.\nMaybe a little bit of hope is the only motivation he has to keep on living.'\n\nAlthough these conclusions unavoidably contain some of the opinions of the individual who collected this intelligence, we still trust in her ability to organize clues.\nOur response to the incident depends on the decision itself, but at the very least, we may already understand the reason why the General often merely sighs at Miss Neon's improper behavior.",

He earned a major reputation during the Tenth Urcha War. An Ursus soldier with these kinds of achievements is rare indeed.\nDuring the Bloodpeak Campaign, he established a glowing military record but then vanished without a trace. There is only one high-ranking Ursus commander that meets these conditions.\nAs for how I made the inference, well, it's just a guess! Over several decades, Ursus has executed over a hundred commanders. The few left alive can be counted on one hand. Consult a registry of names to get the answer!\nIn the past, both Kal'tsit and I would have been opposed to this cooperation. But these are different times. Even■■■■feels that the situation is getting quite thorny.\nKal'tsit believes that after the Chernobog Incident, the Ursus authorities will carry out a frantic counter-attack and that this should be handled through the Ursus infected community.\nMy thinking is a bit simpler. Azazel is buried so deeply that if Rhodes Island dug them out, Ursus wouldn't have much of an opinion on it. Anyway, they're not too familiar with them.\nThe more cards we have to play, the better, and it's not about who plays their cards first. Warfarin also really wants to get her hands on Azazel's technology. Just look at it as me trying to do someone a favor, all right?\nHowever, the Doctor absolutely refuses to let me see Hellagur's writings! Damn it. What's wrong with taking a peek? I'm not going to forget this!\n\nBut what exactly is the General thinking about? Or who exactly is still supporting him?\nSince the Bloodpeak Campaign, the nobility and the new politicians have been using this opportunity to eliminate military forces. Hellagur has been very lucky to survive judgment. Of course, this may be the benefit of his never having participated in politics, but think about this: neither the army nor the politicians will be content with the current situation. They'll both have the next step planned.\nHe'll never divulge much about Azazel. Maybe its secrets are as terrifying as his experiences. Kal'tsit knows that Hellagur isn't Azazel's main leader.\nThis isn't over. His experience, his country, the things he cares about will all drag him down eventually. When the time comes, it may not be up to us whether we can lend him a hand or not.\n——■■■",

The life had already left his friend's body.\nAt the time, he didn't yet know that an unprecedented Great Rebellion was about to ignite war across Ursus, and this lost battle, coupled with the army's disobedience, was only the rebellion's mildest prelude.\nHe could only vaguely sense that, although the storm-in-a-teacup had already dissipated, an unusual calm still lingered.\nHellagur hung the scabbard on his waist and drew out the strange Higashinese sword. He examined it for a moment, but there were no familiar characters on the blade. He placed the sword on the table, presently covered with a battlefield map. The cold and slender blade lay vertically over the tangled front line, forming a large X on the map.\nHe opened the pocket watch to find a photo of a strange girl on the inside. She looked reticent, with only her eyes showing a liveliness and curiosity that matched her age.\nAt that moment, the girl walked out of the shadow in the corner of the command center.\nHer face, figure, clothing, and even the Originium crystal on her shoulder were identical to those in the photo.\nOnly her gaze was different from the one in the photo when she looked at Hellagur.\nThere was no curiosity, no panic, and even hostility seemed thin in her eyes. He could only detect calmness in them, as if her emotional quota had been exhausted by the war.\nHe tried to talk to her, showing her the photo in the watch, and even pointing to the sword on the table, but the girl just stared at him silently, in the same way he had stared at his friend's corpse in silence.\nHellagur realized that, like the sword, this was probably not the first time the girl had been entrusted to someone.\n\nShe suddenly snatched up the sword, which was even taller than her.\nShe held the blade and walked unsteadily towards him.\nThe tall Liberi didn't say anything. The way the girl held it didn't seem like she was preparing to strike.\nOf course, it was possible there were special Higashinese ways to wield the Higashinese sword, or maybe the girl was pretending to make an effort to hold the sword in a way that would keep the edge from being worn on the ground, and he was moments away from having the cold blade pressed against his throat.\nBut Hellagur didn't move.\n\nThe girl's wrist trembled, and she struggled to move to his side. She raised the sword up high, with the tip pointing at the ground.\nHe lowered his head and met the girl's gaze.\nShe seemed to be pleading for something.\nHe didn't know what she was asking for, but he nodded nonetheless.\nWhoosh.\nThe girl inserted the sword into the scabbard at Hellagur's waist.\nThen she spoke. Her command of the common tongue was tinged with a heavy Higashinese accent coupled with twisty Ursine intonation.\n'Don't drop Kudarikiri.'",

      "desc": "The samovar whistles lightly, like the snoring in the trenches at the crack of dawn.\nIt was very many years ago, fresh after the close of a violent battle. Their supplies were spent, and Hellagur was left wanting for even a drop of fresh water as his wounded men-in-arms laid by his side stifling deep groans. He pulled a scar-riddled samovar out from his marching pack, and wearily put a potful of snow to the boil. This one samovar would accompany him for a long, long time to come; each time Neon takes a tea break, she'll mumble about how she ought to throw it away, but of course, she's only saying it.\nNeon's letter lies on the table. Which hurts more to an old man: a young child leaving home because they can't be bothered to communicate with you, or a grown child leaving home out of consideration for how you'd disapprove?\nHellagur has been reflecting on whether his approach to parenting might be suspect. At first, he had no idea how to build a rapport with the taciturn child, sure in his mind that there was no way for him to meaningfully raise her. Bitter war, constant upheaval, blight and suffering... He'd seen that all of these had already made their place in her eyes. The best he could hope for was to teach Neon that life was more than these. He brought more into her life, taught her an appreciation for classical music, to play the cello, to read and write... When did Neon change? After she was found secretly taking part in the Clinic's transport of Oripathy medication? Since leaving Chernobog, she's become her own dignified spokeswoman. From settling patients to partnered pharmaceutical research between the Clinic and Rhodes Island, Neon handled many aspects of rebuilding Azazel. Medical and clinical administration were never Hellagur's strong points anyway... Neon often vanishes, only to show back up with a new headache or two for him... Perhaps this was how she always was, but suffice to say, it's how she likes it.\nHellagur is glad he can still protect such a lifestyle.\n...Hence, he regrets not properly hiding the letter.\nThat winter, they'd done everything they could, and had the Clinic's patients, doctors, and medical resources all evacuated from Chernobog... Yet the name 'Azazel' was forsaken there, left behind.\nThese days, new nomadic plates sit atop the ruins, an omnipresent smog of industry and checkpoints and the Ursus Guard, still going by the name of 'Chernobog.' And Azazel has been 'rebuilt' in a sense, the Emperor's overseers tacitly letting it exist. 'Azazel.' The name itself something to believe in. Once, it was a rare respite to those the Empire deemed scar tissue, a safe haven in the endless nights. With no hesitation, the Infected chose where it had once been to come together again, and even the Infected that wandered the wilds and tundras came too, of their own accord.\nTo Ursus, they always were hideous scars. Had the events of 1096 been sufficient to change the Empire's attitude towards them? The answer is laughable. In the so-called 'Federal Territory of Chernobog' is no Ursus Guard, who only care to stand watch outside of it, and to Hellagur, and of course to Neon, the role that the vaunted 'Azazel' plays atop those ruins is all too clear. In the new plate crammed full of Infected, death and disappearance may be diluted in the greater chaos, but they are still taking place, right this very moment.\nThe hot-blooded child cannot stand such a thing. She quietly comes back, brews a pot of tea for Hellagur, and then takes Decapitator and leaves without a goodbye...\nSteam lifts the lid as the water within boils louder and louder, slowly drowning out the sound of the samovar itself.\nQuiet, now. Quiet as the dead winter grass.\n'We can never hope to be an opponent to Ursus. To its traitors, the Empire bestows illusions and humiliation.\n'We can never hope to turn our backs on the past, for it will never be erased. We can never hope to turn our backs on the past, for it binds your future tight. Hellagur.'",
