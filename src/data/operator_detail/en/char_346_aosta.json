There, the families run the show behind all public affairs. \nThanks to this unique characteristic, life in Siracusa is quite strange even in this diverse world, and Aosta understands clearly that the Siracusan lifestyle is not what people of other origins would consider normal. \nIt's difficult to say what makes a normal lifestyle and what doesn't. However, when the authorities avoid getting involved with the wars between families, it's safe to say that life in Siracusa can hardly be called normal. \nAosta knows so much about the environment he grew up in, and still manages to harbor such doubts about the place.

Let's put on wigs, change our clothes, and slip out of the city with the acrobats.'\n'Shh, keep your voice down. You'll blow our cover!'\n'Hey, I'm serious; I've really thought this one through! We just smashed a pie right in the face of the most notorious don in Locomotiva City—and honestly, he deserved it. But we didn't have time to grab even a single coin before running. Now we're lost, and the streets are full of people ready to turn us into mincemeat. If we don't do something, we're done for.'\n'We're not lost. This is the back alley behind Baron's Pub, and there's an abandoned warehouse right across the street. We can hide there temporarily. There's even a working landline inside.' Aosta pulls a city map from his waist pouch.\n'And what is this wobbly line here?'\n'Our escape route—the one you just ran along!'\n'Broca... did you know he planned all this?!'\n'No, but it doesn't surprise me.'\n'You mentioned a landline—who are you planning to call, anyway?'\n'The guy who gave us meds last time. Our car's still with him.' As he speaks, Aosta takes out a business card from his pouch with the words 'Right Angle, Rhodes Island Operator' printed on it.\n'I could help him remodel that boring office of his as payment.'\n'We were caught off guard the last time we had to flee,' Aosta says, taking out a few coins from his pouch, 'I'm not going unprepared this time.'\n'Aosta! You said you didn't have any money for my modding supplies, but you were hiding cash! What else do you got in that pouch? Probably not anything good to eat, though. Ugh... I'm starving. Is there any meat we could roast in that abandoned warehouse?'\nAosta opens his pouch again and takes out two candies in plain packaging.\n'I'll never say you're like my mom again! But... only two? If there's one for both of us, what about you?'\n'I'm not hungry.'\n'There's that mom tone again...'\n'Shut up and eat the candy. Do I have to unwrap it for you?'\n'Alright...'\nHe tears open the candies and throws the wrappers to the ground. Chiave's expression shifts from gratitude to confusion to disgust.\n'Ugh! What is this?! It tastes awful!'\nThe white-haired Lupo, who had remained stoic and serious throughout their escape, finally breaks into a smile.\n'It's booger-flavored trick candy, to curb your appetite.' He raises a finger. 'The thugs outside have thinned out. Are you ready, you two? On the count of three, we dash for that warehouse.'",
