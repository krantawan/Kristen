The laborers, made of flesh and blood, were simply not meant to keep up with these massive industrial machines—And so her parents chose to settle in a remote but quiet Columbian town, a place that was getting farther and farther away from the roars of the pioneers' machines by the day.

She came here simply because she wanted reliable work.\nAlthough she may not look it given her cute appearance, as someone who was born in a family of laborers, Pinecone has a lot of tricks up her sleeve. She has a decent handle on a variety of crafts and chores, and ever since she became a Rhodes Island employee, she has been training under our Engineering operators. Under their tutelage, she has picked up everything almost at a lightning pace as though it's all in her blood.\nPinecone even managed to complete the training room's maintenance work in half the time it would take other Logistics operators, and when asked, she simply answered, 'It all comes naturally to me... I guess? I'm not too sure myself... Anyway, I got it taken care of... I-Is there something wrong?'",

Although she knows almost nothing about more complex modern engineering techniques, she is very capable with simple repairs and maintenance work. Whenever there is no hot water at the showers or the fans have stopped working, you can count on her to take care of it all with feverish haste and a loud yawn. Because of her approachable personality, she rarely turns down any of the small requests she gets from other operators. That said, we would like certain operators to refrain from asking her to renovate the dormitories, as this requires prior authorization.\nPinecone seems to be rather content about her current living situation. At first, we were worried whether her close contact with our Infected operators would give her any undue mental stress, but according to Pinecone herself, back in her hometown, Infected explorers would come and go in droves month after month to participate in Columbia's Great Expansion. When she was asked what she thought of this 'Great Expansion' herself, she gave a simple yet undeniably fascinating answer.\n'The city... is a glorious place.'",

            "storyText": "A few years ago, a sudden, unexpected event shook Pinecone's family—Pinecone's father almost lost both his arms in a construction accident.\nIt isn't uncommon to find Columbian laborers wind up in disputes with the big corporations. The insurance industry, having been built atop these games of words and conspiracies, naturally had a way with words to weasel out of paying their benefits. Of course, it should come as no surprise that the insurance companies were unwilling to pay for a medical bill this expensive. And while all parties involved were still trying to pass the buck, the hospitals naturally refused to treat a workman who was unlikely to be able to pay for his treatment. The reason this tragedy occurred in the first place is that Pinecone's father had signed a contract that was manipulated, allowing the construction company to legally get away from paying him any compensation.\nWho could say a father who only ever wanted the best for his daughter and did everything to help her leave that small town was to blame? The contract he had to sign just to be hired as a construction worker was dozens of pages thick; it shouldn't be hard to tell where the problem actually lies.\nAll Pinecone could do was comfort her crying mother as her father signed his release forms, thus refusing any further treatment—Yet, out of nowhere, one of the material suppliers on the project sent them a substantial sum and footed the medical bill out of 'humanitarian concerns.' After that, the construction company's head honchos finally found the time to leave their offices and pay Pinecone's family a visit at the hospital, even promising to properly compensate her family. Naturally, Pinecone was bewildered by the company's sudden change in attitude after this secret benefactor came into the picture. She tried over and over to figure out who they were, but, after her constant probings, the construction company would only give her the name 'Simon Co.' 'Simon' is a very common name in Columbia, and it took a very long time for Pinecone to find out who it was that helped her family.\nSimilarly, even though Mountain was certainly seething when the disgraceful labor dispute was brought up during a meeting, he didn't actually know whose family his subsequent tirade had saved.",

Would an innocent girl like her normally say yes when asked to apply to work in a prison and help a felon escape?\nThe answer is actually very simple.\nKafka figured out what it was when she was looking through the files, and immediately located Pinecone, who was at the time aimlessly looking for a job.\n'I've got a pretty nice job lined up for you...

Hello, Mina, you must have heard of the 'hidden singer,' right?'\n'Uh... not really.'\n'It's been causing quite a buzz! The whole thing is so strange. For an entire week, the cafeteria speakers played a song at the same time every morning. But when fans of the song asked around, the broadcast room staff insisted that no one had played any music or sung in there!'\n'Ah, I've been up on the scaffold each morning this week, refinishing the wall, so I must've missed it. Shucks, what a shame.'\n'Then maybe you can help us, Mina. Based on the accent and lyrics, I'm pretty sure the voice belongs to a Colombian operator! She was singing: Onward! Onward! Dig! Dig! Build! Build! Our city must keep growing!'\n'The dust falls in our eyes, as the towers rise—wait, you got me singing along! Haha!'\n'Yes, exactly! That's how it goes! Wait, your voice sounds somewhat similar... but they sang with so much more energy!'\n'If you don't belt your heart out on the worksite, the foreman'll think you're slacking. But if you ask me who else know this song...'\n'—Yes, very suspicious indeed. Mina, you're used to singing at work, and it just so happens that every time this mysterious singing started, you were on the job? I think we'll need to check out your work area.'\nThe upper platform of Rhodes Island Cafeteria.\n'Hello, everyone! Are we any closer to the truth now? So, this is the wall Mina's been working on, right? Wait, what's this I found?!' 'That's my mobile powerbank. I always leave it in place till the job's done.'\n'I mean what's on top of it—look! It's a microphone!'\n'Oh, that old thing? It's just for fun. Look, you can see the beautiful nomadic city in the distance through the porthole; who wouldn't wanna sing before such a nice view? But my wireless speaker's broken, so no way the sound's making it downstairs.'\n'Hmm? Oh!'\nWith a sudden gasp, Click grabs the microphone. 'Ladies and gentlemen, we've solved the mystery! The hidden singer is—'\nMina looks at the microphone in confusion. It was supposed to connect to the wireless speaker in front of her, but instead—somehow she had connected it to an unfamiliar speaker labeled 'Cafeteria Hall.'\n'Ah... was it really me?'\nRemembering how she'd sung those corny lyrics, thinking no one could hear, Mina winces and covers her face.",
