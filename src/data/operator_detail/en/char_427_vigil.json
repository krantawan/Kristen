Aosta and Broca, who were with him at the time, seemed reluctant to show their faces. However, the scenario that people were expecting to break out did not unfold, and Vigil had a calm and cordial conversation with Chiave's gang.\nThis conversation ended with Chiave's arm around Vigil's shoulder, and Chiave proclaiming to the surrounding operators that his gang would celebrate Vigil's arrival.\nAccording to the recollection of an operator present at the time:\n'Had people not already been familiar with Chiave's personality, they might've mistaken him for the one with the higher status back there.'",

Of all the countries across this land, perhaps only in Siracusa can a city like this – independent of the existing powers – pop up out of thin air without causing widespread panic and backlash.\nThe existence of this city undeniably represents a future recognized by Signoria Sicilia, a challenge to authority that may well unfold in Siracusa; however, it is also destined to stand in opposition to the other mafias.\nVigil sought out Rhodes Island on the basis of medical needs.\nAs a rule, Rhodes Island normally tries to avoid cooperating with such politically sensitive entities. However, when Operator Texas brought him and Penance before Dr. Kal'tsit's office, the situation became much more complicated.\nHe made no effort to conceal the events that had unfolded in Old Volsinii. His vision of the future ultimately moved Rhodes Island, and so this relationship was realized.\nHis reason for choosing to become an operator seems almost ordained by fate – what he said was, he saw how Rhodes Island gathered people from all across the land and all walks of life, and he wanted to spend more time communicating with and learning from them.\nHe displayed a genuine thirst for knowledge of things beyond Siracusa, and his humility has won him the acknowledgement of most operators.\nAs such, he has already made many friends, and they openly speak highly of him.\nIt can even be said that Vigil's arrival changed many peoples' impressions of Siracusans.\nConsequently, this has also led him to stay at Rhodes Island for longer periods of time than his identity allows, which Penance frequently berates him for.",

While Penance has not really admitted to this point, she has also not gone out of her way to deny it.\nHowever, it is no mystery that both Penance and her ideals are special to him.\n'I was brought up to be the famiglia's heir. From the very beginning, I've always been pursuing ways of expanding the famiglia's power, and ways of doing my job more efficiently. I'm not such a noble person.' During a chat with the Doctor, when the topic of his origins came up, he smiled and explained: 'Now that I think about it, that was from before when Famiglia Texas was liquidated. As the power and influence of the Colombian famiglie grew, some of their ideals and practices started to leak over into Siracusa as well. For better or worse, Siracusa's famiglie also started to become more 'civilized,' and that affected me to some degree as well.'\n'Originally, I was going to become someone who would stop at nothing to secure advantages for the famiglia. But, Lavinia... Alright, I'll call her Penance here, since she seems to like that codename. Anyways, after my father brought her into the famiglia, things changed.'\nAfter getting to this point, Vigil paused for a while, as if carefully considering his words. 'So many things happened along the way, including her dispute with my father. In the end, she decided to accept the position of judge that he arranged for her, but this isn't a story you should be hearing from me – ask her yourself if you're interested. Looking back, in the process of learning as much as I could to become an effective leader of the famiglia, I not only learned about Siracusa's rules and Columbia's cunning, but also of the justice she had never given up.'\n'Unfortunately, Demetri had always been tasked with the responsibility of intel gathering, so he was always running around and had little time to talk to Penance. If he had the same opportunities as me, maybe we wouldn't have turned out like this.' He let out a sigh. 'Forget it, let's not talk about this anymore.'\n'In any case, Doctor, I see Penance as a superbly upstanding person. For her to be able to hold onto her ideals in a place like Siracusa is an incredibly rare and precious thing. Plus, my mother passed away at a young age, and my father... though we didn't have a bad relationship by any means, there were certain things that I could not easily share with him, so...' He suddenly showed some hesitation and paused for a while when he got to this point, before finally continuing: 'When I was still relatively young, she played both an older sister role, as well as...'\n'Vigil, I need to talk to you about the planning of the new city. Also, I heard the quality of your work hasn't been up to par lately; have you been staying up late again?' From not too far away came a clear, pristine female voice. Without a doubt, it belonged to Penance.\n'Uhh... Doctor, if you'd excuse me.' Vigil stood up and trotted towards the voice, mumbling justifications for himself as he ran: 'It's not like I held up the project or anything.'\nIn that rare moment, he appeared to be just another impetuous, fearless youth.",

Because he already knew that the answer he'd receive would be no different from what he told Demetri.\nIn the end, he cast aside his former brother and set out on a thorny path that had never before seen the light of day.\nVigil is afraid.\nHe does not know if he will be able to succeed.\nWhen he sat across from Signora Sicilia, he was already prepared to go out in a blaze of glory. After all, he never intended on answering to her. In the face of her casual yet also fateful question, he could only put his most heartfelt thoughts and ideas forward, and truthfully admitted to her that his ideas were far from bulletproof.\nAfter all, even if a new ideal had already sprouted within his heart, it was still immature.\nVigil is anxious.\nHe feels that there is too much for him to learn.\nWhile serving as Minister Carracci's secretary, he never had to deal with anything particularly complicated. But when confronted with official duties that would influence the operations of an entire city, he immediately came face-to-face with his shortcomings. This deficiency causes him a great deal of grief, as he is aware that the only thing that can fill this gap is time, which is the one thing he lacks.\nDespite that, all he can do is put his head down and do what needs to be done, nose to the grindstone. There is no other way.\nRegardless, Vigil knows that he is fortunate enough.\nSignora Sicilia accepted his challenge. He has Penance and Texas at his side to assist him. Furthermore, there are people in Nuova Volsinii who are also motivated to build a new city.\nHe treads down a path that he cleaved opened for himself.\nHe cannot assert that Siracusa will change as a result of his actions, but he knows that what he plans to do will leave an indelible mark upon the land of Siracusa.\nAnd he is ready to give everything.",

This is one of the few times when he reveals his cold, ruthless side, and may perhaps be the only conservative part of this young man who is otherwise committed to change and novelty.\nHe will carefully examine each recipe in advance, urge Procurement to obtain raw ingredients from local, trustworthy Siracusan suppliers, and personally participate in the creation of each dish. Under such circumstances, even the most creative and liberated chefs are unwilling to leave their personal touches in these dishes, lest their intent to 'add tropical fruits to provide a wonderful taste and texture to the sauce' earns them the premonition that 'someone is secretly staring at them from the darkness, warning that their lives are not securely in their hands.'\nHowever, once Vigil leaves the landship, these same chefs will retaliate by making new renditions of Siracusan classics.

He had shined Bernardo's shoes for thirty years, and the man always respected those who respected him. The last time he had stepped into this parlor, it was so that he could offer Bernardo the chance to name his son.\nHis fear comes from the fact that the one sitting here today is not Bernardo, but his son, Leontuzzo.\nHe has not heard much about the Bellone heir. All he knew was that the young master had never come to him for a shoe shining.\n'My father isn't here at the moment, but you can trust me as you trusted him.'\nHis words calm him a bit, allowing the shoe-shiner to explain why he had no choice but to come:\nHis son leads a decent, honorable life, and fell in love with a lady from Columbia. However, that lady was also being pursued by a maniac who didn't take kindly to a rival. Three nights ago, his son was cornered by that maniac and beaten within an inch of his life. He'd sought aid from the courts, but the man belonged to a Columbian famiglia, and his lawyers were easily able to secure a 'not guilty.'\n'When I was leaving the courtroom, he stepped in front of me and shoved two banknotes into my pocket. He laughed as he told me it was for my son's medical fees. I...' The shoe-shiner went on, tears streaming from his wizened eyes.\nLeontuzzo listens in silence. He knows that if his father were here, he would surely give the old man a pat on the shoulder, acknowledge his suffering, then provide a solution to this. A humane way.\nGenerally speaking, these things could only be resolved with bloodshed.\nBut that was not how he does things.\n'What is it you wish for, signor?'\n'I have no requests, Don Leontuzzo, other than justice for my boy.'\n'Justice. Am I to understand that you want this man to feel the same pain your son did?'\n'That's right. Nothing more.'\nLeontuzzo snaps his fingers, and a red-headed young man steps out from a door to the side.\n'Demetri, go investigate the gang behind that guy first.'\n'Easy enough, but what comes next?'\n'Next... If I'm not mistaken, those Columbian gangs want to sidestep us and cozy up to the local government. Then let's propose sending local 'talents' to the Columbian frontier. Hopefully, every famiglia will enthusiastically agree. Let them send off a few stronzi who should have been exiled long ago.'\nThe red-headed youth snaps his fingers. 'So we'll ship this guy off too?'\n'Exactly.'\n'Capisco.'\nWith that final declaration, the man leaves the room. Leontuzzo turns towards the astonished shoe-shiner. 'This is the justice I can give you. Are you satisfied with it, signor?'\nThe shoe-shiner quickly catches on, and his gaze turns from astonishment to gratitude.\n'Take this.'\n'This is...'\n'My pistola. Place it by your shoe-shiner, and nobody will cause you trouble.'\n'But—'\n'Don't worry. I barely use it. Whenever you feel like you can sleep easy again, just give it back to the guard downstairs.'",
