She will more often try to execute operations single-handedly and leave her teammates to clean up her mess, which has fostered resentment. \nPlaying off her cold, sarcastic demeanor toward others and her relentlessness in battle, a rumor has emerged that she is part-demon. \nAlthough Amiya quelled the rumor, it didn't stop there. Instead, it evolved into something even more extreme. A later version abandoned anything derogatory and focused on stories of her immense power. \nIn the minds of Operators who don't know her, she comes off as a walking Catastrophe.",

The materials used to forge the sword are ordinary, but the craftsmanship is impossible to explain. Some Operators from remote areas have seen similar weapons, but are not aware of the source. \nHolding this giant sword would be difficult for most people, but not for the unstoppable Skadi. Unlike most Operators who wear heavy armor to protect themselves, Skadi relies only on her sword and her strength. \nThe damage she inflicts is even more impressive than her imposing appearance. \nAfter returning from a mission with Skadi, other Operators often exaggerate her physical prowess in their reports, to the point where she sounds like a legendary monster. \nAlthough Skadi has little interest in debriefings, she humors the higher-ups anyway, typically complaining about how her teammates got in her way or that the rules of engagement are too constricting. \nSkadi excels at fighting large masses of enemies, but also tends to cause excessive property damage. This includes wrecked buildings, mangled fences, and once collapsing an entire fort. \nSkadi is very similar to another Operator, Specter. \nMuch like Specter, Skadi is not good with Originium. But for Skadi, taking down a target as quickly as possible is the most effective tactic. \nAll this taken together, Skadi is quite unstable. Although she is well-behaved, has followed orders, and completed her missions, she operates like an out-of-control freight train in combat and that should be restrained. \nStill, Rhodes Island may need a force of nature like Skadi for certain missions.",

They are also perplexed by her propensity to abandon the squad and complete missions by herself. \nSome Operators suggest talking to her and helping her fit in to the company, but they are in the minority. \nMost people don't know the only reason Skadi refuses to cooperate with others is that she 'doesn't want to put anyone else in danger.' \nSkadi claims everyone who has ever been close to her has met an untimely end, and as such she has avoided socializing altogether. \nDespite our misgivings, Rhodes Island respects her social choices as long as she does not violate any of our rules. \nRegardless of where it stems from: her birth, her behavior, her body, or her experiences, the mystery of Skadi remains. \nOccasionally, others have seen her sitting on the edge of the deck, softly singing to herself. Those who heard the song reported that although they couldn't hear the lyrics, the tune was long, low, and imbued them with a sense of tremendous sorrow.",

But fortunately, I had anticipated her needs, and I think Rhodes Island would be good for her. \nI explained why we were speaking. She reluctantly agreed and promised to divulge certain information in exchange for Rhodes Island's intelligence gathering assistance. \nHer preference for isolation stems from a desire to protect others. She has no malicious intent. However, she is hesitant to trust a capable, powerful organization like Rhodes Island. \nThis is because she believes she has to resolve her own issues. \nIn our long conversation, I promised to her on behalf of the Doctor (and if the Doctor doesn't like this, well, it's for the greater good!) that if an unknown peril hit Rhodes Island that we could not resist, we would give her up. \nI came to two conclusions:\n1. There is a secret organization to which Skadi has close ties. Not only is this organization hostile, it is violent. \n2. This organization goes far beyond just Skadi herself. From her description, I think they experimented on Skadi. Or they could be trying to entice her, little by little. Another possibility is they can't control her right now and don't want to deal with her until they've crushed her spirit. \n\nSkadi also hoped she could find something that would prevent future tragedy. \nDoes that sound antisocial? Wandering alone is a heavy burden to bear... \nSigh, she became a wanderer because she was trying to escape, and also showing some rebellion. \n\nI think... \nI think the Doctor should be in charge of Skadi. Isn't taking care of an Operator's needs necessary to build trust?\nOh, Kal'tsit will disagree with me. If she finds out I'm the one who said all this, she'll probably hang me from the bridge for everyone to see.\n\n--■■■",

A current pulls at her, trying to drag her into the ocean's depths. \nSkadi does not resist. \nGradually, the light fades from her vision, the environment around her becomes pitch-dark, and the pressure around her continuously increases. The only information about her environment reaches her through the water's flow and echoed sounds. \nBut, it makes Skadi feel at ease. It is the environment she is most familiar with. When she goes on missions with her companions as an Abyssal Hunter, she slaughters the Seaborn in waters like these, and returns to that city sitting on the sea. \nBut right now, only icy water surrounds her. \nShe begins to feel lonely. \n...... \nShe is about to arrive at the sea floor, where an underwater city flickers into view. \nOnce upon a time, these Ægir technological marvels could illuminate the bottom. But in today's memories, this city-cluster still emits a radiant glow. \nBut... \nAt some point, the city became both distant and unfamiliar. \nSkadi belongs to the sea, but she does not belong there. \nShe falls onto the sea floor, motionless. \nShe is lonely. \n...... \nA song suddenly sounds out through the sea. \nA song of nature without words, without emotions. \nShe hears it. \nThe surrounding 'creatures' follow the sound and approach––\nThey grow more numerous. Yet more numerous. \nIn the Ægir's shattered light, they appear–– \nSea Terrors, Seaborn, and the unparalleled Behemoths of the sea. \nAlmost reflexively, Skadi stands up, the Ægir greatsword appearing in her hand. \nAfter grasping the current's flow around her, she charges at the swarm of monsters in front of her. Several vague shadows accompany her in her charge forward. They are clad in outfits similar to Skadi's, and wield Behemoth-slaying weapons. \nAt that moment, Skadi feels–– \nSnap! \nSkadi wakes up. She is lying on a bed, with medical equipment around her still running. \nA Rhodes Island psychiatric operator is staring at the readings on the device, the hand that had produced that snap still suspended in midair, the other hand continuing to jot down notes. \n'How do you feel right now, Operator Skadi?' \n'I feel–– \nVery good.'",

The air moist, too moist, so much so that it bears her with ease. A mere reach, a wave of the hand, and her body floats up, weightless. People, so many people, arms spread wide, roaming through the night, freed and at peace.\nSkadi does not swim into the sky. She is sat on the shore, silently watching the scene before her, gentle waves at times caressing her boots. Her sword, ever her companion, rests by her side. On the other, there sits a girl dressed in a red dancer's dress. She wears a broad hat, behind which Skadi cannot see her face. She has hair as soft and white as her own, and so Skadi feels she is close, familiar. Like any other dream, this one has no beginning. By the time she realizes she's dreaming, she is already sitting there.\nThe girl in red speaks. 'Are you a hunter?' she asks, voice ineffable and captivating.\n'Yes.'\n'Do you like to hunt?'\n'I can't say I like it. But terrifying creatures are always threatening my kin. Someone has to fight them.'\n'To defend your kin's lives, you must hunt other races?'\n'Possibly. Maybe.'\n'But then, why can we not all become kin?' the girl asks, sincere.\n'Is everyone kin, where you are?' Skadi replies.\nThe girl seems to ponder carefully for a while, then nods.\n'We don't need to hunt each other, in the place I am.'\n'Then what do you normally do?'\n'I do nothing. I sing.'\n'It sounds like your home is more peaceful than mine.'\n'It is just as you see now.'\nThe girl extends a slender finger, pointing far away. At the edge of vision, the line separating sea from sky is given a formless end. All life blends together, no difference, no distance.\n'Goodbye. I have to go.' Skadi takes her sword and stands.\n'Are you going to hunt?'\n'I have to wake up. Once I do, yes. I'll carry on hunting.'\n'I hope that one day, you can be free of this destiny.'\n'If possible.'\n......\nWhen Skadi dreamt this dream, she had not yet left Ægir. And like many other dreams, it became a fragment of a memory, buried deep in a corner of the waves of her mind. And when she dresses in that red dancer's dress in Sal Viento, that memory remains silent.\n'Now I look nothing like a hunter.' Skadi stares at herself in the mirror, murmuring.\n'Who are you, right now?'",
