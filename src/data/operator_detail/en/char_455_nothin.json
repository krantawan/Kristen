Thanks to some fateful coincidences, Mr. Nothing had the fortune to be picked out by a woman from Kou-wu City, surname Lien. He was brought to the city to learn martial arts, and there he settled down.\nSome cities in Yan have traditions of martial arts establishments, ever since ancient times. However, following the expansion in scope of nomadic cities, and the formation of communication links between city-states and even whole countries, the feel of these 'martial arts of the people' underwent much change. A great deal of youths nowadays practice them, many to keep themselves fit, with self-defense as an aim. Martial arts tournaments held by establishments all over, with grand stages, come to make business activities a primary concern. Still, a tiny proportion hold to the attitude that 'martial arts should halt a war,' and silently pass on those genuine teachings. Certainly, Mr. Nothing's school was one of those.\n'My only issue was learning it wouldn't earn me much. Times of peace, eh.' —Mr. Nothing",

Obviously, he doesn't avoid bringing up his so-called 'enemy' at all.\nGoing by a simple investigation, and inquiries with Mr. Nothing himself, the dispute at Lien's can be seen as a deliberate conspiracy—they set things up for an unidentifiable 'boxer' to die in a contest at Mr. Nothing's hands. This gave all the local powers an excuse to pressure the Liens. Come the end, his master bled dry, and he was forced to go incognito, fleeing far from his homeland.\nAccording to Mr. Nothing, his master was old. Not only that, but her disciples numbered few, with no real money or power to their names, nor any show they could make of ability. The Liens was situated in Kou-wu City, yet not lively enough to match even next door's gymnasium. Why all sorts from all corners would come to target this tiny little school, and why people are still out for Mr. Nothing's life while he poses no threat so far away from home, those are the mystifying points.\nQuestioned directly, Mr. Nothing gave a bitter chuckle, and then a rather evasively phrased reply: such is martial arts.\nAfterwards, Mr. Nothing began expounding knowhow on growing rice in the paddies, diverting from the topic.",

However, we trust Miss Lava and Miss Kroos, and so we will... continue to survey Mr. Nothing's conduct, and supplement records accordingly.\n[Report Addendum]\nReport addendum, uh, I just saw Mr. Nothing use his fan somehow knock down that drunk Sarkaz.

And he only had light injuries!\n[Report Addendum 3]\nReport addendum... the bounty hunters are already rounded up. When we got here, it was just a mess of guys all knocked out on the floor... d-did Mr. Nothing do this all by himself? They were armed, right? And they had Casters?\n[Report Addendum 4]\nMr. Nothing said he just got caught, then luckily he noticed the bandits' boss had an opening, then luckily his ropes came undone, and then luckily he knocked 'em all out... also, he said because no layman ever sees fans and umbrellas as weapons, that was the only reason he had any chance, and, uh, 'it's scarcely imagined that even chopsticks can kill.' Jeez. I'm scared of him.\n[Report Addendum 5]\nI was starting to believe Mr. Nothing was the real deal, but then I went to go consult him today, and he just tossed me this crumpled-up exercise dieting manual whatever, and he even asked me if I wanted to become a member.

He bolted the gate of the kung fu hall from the inside, and in the dead of night, took a copper rod from the weapon rack used for emergencies, climbed the wall, and left the courtyard. \nNot long afterwards, a town near Kou-wu City found itself one sunglass-sporting fortune-teller extra. On sunny days, he would set up his stall at intersections, and on rainy days with few pedestrians, he would take his umbrella and go fishing by the river outside town. The umbrella perfectly covered him, its ribs heavy so it would not blow away. Some envied him for living such a flamboyant lifestyle - was he so attuned to Heaven's will that he could keep his head up above the ocean of mundane affairs? Others accused him of being a cheat and a fraud, questioning if he really knew his own destiny. \n'Of course. How could I not know?' He would reply with a smile. \nAn umbrella only protects one from the rain, but not against concealed weapons like arrows or darts. His umbrella torn, he has no choice but to pack his bags and find another town where he could mend his umbrella. Numerous are the days of dark wind and rain, and he gradually feels that he had nowhere to go. All he knows is that the endpoint of his life will still be at that martial arts hall. He needs not walk the path that follows afterwards, but he knows not how to traverse the path leading there. The inch of ground beneath his umbrella is hardly enough for him to settle down, for it is no solid roof. \nBut it is then that he meets a strange group of people. Later, he learns another saying from those people. If translated into mandarin Yanese, it would be 'Heaven's mandate lies in man.' \n––The above is what Operator Mr. Nothing told you personally. Rhodes Island is currently running from a small-scale Catastrophe in the making at full speed, but Mr. Nothing is lying on a chair without a worry in the world, his umbrella tied and tucked away at his side. Through the porthole, you can see the sun behind the Originium rain. \n'The sky clears after the rain passes. The Heavens have eyes, and gaze down upon us. Say, Doctor, would you care for a pair of sunglasses?'",
