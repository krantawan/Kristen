            "storyText": "Operator Sharp was born in Columbia to two mercenaries. He received combat training from his parents since he was little, and later followed them as they emigrated to Sargon. Then, having traveled and worked under multiple padishahs, he finally left Sargon and joined Rhodes Island as one of its first operators when it was established.\nIn his own words: 'My life as a mercenary has been nothing but ordinary.' Indeed, he has no notable achievements from his time in Sargon. That said, if by 'ordinary' he means he fought there for some twenty years, he would have participated in over a hundred battles—both large and small—and made it safely out of every single one. In which case, we would be hard-pressed to find a more formidable soldier in all of Terra.\nFurthermore, when Sharp first came aboard, he had a very clear-cut attitude toward his missions. He never did anything unnecessary, and also clearly avoided coming into contact with other operators. Yet as he began to trust Rhodes Island, and we in turn showed him more of Terra, he started to change his attitude and slowly began to show his true strength in combat.\nRegarding that, Sharp had this to say to Dr. Kal'tsit when he was invited to become an elite operator: 'I gradually realized that Rhodes Island is a company that rewards us for the effort we put in.'\nNaturally, we had long realized that the 'reward' Sharp speaks of refers not to monetary compensation but to some kind of ideal. He had used to hope that his fighting would serve some sort of greater cause, but in the end, reality left him disappointed, and he had no choice but to bury that disappointment by focusing on work. That is, until his arrival here at Rhodes Island.\nAt first, Sharp was clearly derisive of our ideals. He had served many men in Sargon full of empty promises. Besides, our ideal was simply too grandiose. However, we eventually proved through our actions that, no matter how hard this ideal is to achieve, we are slowly making our way toward it. He was finally moved.\nAnd so, Elite Operator Sharp was born.\nBy the time he formally became an elite operator, he had no more reservations about Rhodes Island, and at the same time became less reserved himself. He started to earnestly consult our medics on medical knowledge he'd heard, train with Stormeye all night until daybreak, and even crack jokes during missions. Thanks to this, many operators have come to know him as a warm-hearted man, despite his cold appearance.\nEven today, Sharp describes his missions as 'work.' Yet, owing to how well our elite operators know each other, this itself has become a topic of conversation among his friends. No one loves his work more than Sharp, they say.",
