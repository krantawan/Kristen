Due to the bitter consequences of wealth inequality and classism from a young age, Sideroca left Corinia to wander the various Minosian city-states as a mercenary. In the past, she always wanted to go far away from Corinia to see different facets of life, but after some time as a mercenary, she realized she would never be able to flee from Corinia, the heart of Minosian trade as well as her splendid motherland. However, her struggle was not fruitless - in her line of work, she came across two other nomadic city-states that rivaled her home: Athenus, the spiritual garden of Minos, and Lakedaímōn, the sacred ground of warriors. In these places, she was able to encounter different philosophies as well as different ways of life, and at the same time, it was in these places that the vast world beyond Minos was revealed to her. One day, she will leave her home and travel to a new country. If Corinia taught anything to Sideroca, it is perhaps a lifelong desire for exploration and a deep pragmatism.",

Many people have voiced doubts about whether such a young woman would be qualified for that line of work, but Sideroca's first employer, the president of the Minos branch of Rhodes Island, did not share those concerns. As long as the task can be successfully completed, she cared not for the experience, or lack thereof, of the person carrying out the task. By the time Sideroca officially joined Rhodes Island, she had an impressive track record of zero tasks failed, even completing tasks that allowed the mercenaries to abandon their goods in order to ensure their own safety. Of course, her accomplishments also came at a price, perhaps evident by the extra scars across her body. After several years of cooperation, the head of Rhodes Island's Minos branch decided to grandfather her into the main organization - after all, she didn't want this trusty talent to be snatched up by competitors. As such, Sideroca officially became an operator of Rhodes Island.",

The other group called her 'nosy, with the very troublesome tendency of asking too many questions.' The reason for these two different types of evaluations is actually quite simple: Sideroca habitually wants to go above and beyond for her employer. While this is beneficial to completing the task, it can also be unsuitable for employers who wish to conceal information from their mercenary hires. The head of Rhodes Island's Minos branch once gave her the following advice: 'Only take on short-term contracts, or stick with one employer until retirement.' She understands that Sideroca's cold personality cannot conceal her inner dedication and work ethic. By working under the right employer, it is possible to achieve twice the outcome with half the effort, but once... because of this very reason, when she learned that the Minos Foreign Trade Union was attempting to strike a long-term deal with Sideroca, she went directly to Sideroca to snag her up before she could sign that contract. When representatives from the Trade Union arrived at Sideroca's temporary residence, she had already left Minos to start a new life at Rhodes Island. However, there was one thing that even the savvy branch leader could not anticipate...\nIf Sideroca really stayed under the same employer for too long...",

            "storyText": "Perhaps because she had never received prior formal training, Sideroca still clearly remembers her experiences training to become an Operator. At the time, Instructor Dobermann also has very 'vivid' memories of Sideroca. She says that while it is normal for people to proactively improve themselves during Hell Week, it is inexplicable that someone would ever want to put themselves through Hell Week ever again. In her eyes, Sideroca is the kind of person who can incorporate a brutal regimen like Hell Week as part of their own regular fitness routine, even with already excellent qualities. Because Sideroca kept signing up again and again, Dobermann put her foot down and no longer allowed Sideroca to take the same courses as fresh recruits - after all, that would only serve to intimidate them. Consequently, Dobermann put together a specialized regimen, delving into new training manuals, standard army training, and special operations training and incorporating them to meet Sideroca's needs. She even made an agreement with Dur-nar afterwards, gaining her support in exchange for compromises in some other areas, in order to work together against this person who constantly made the life of the instructors that much harder. Eventually, they discovered that only two things could tear Sideroca away from this almost self-destructive urge to train - going out on missions, or diverting her attention onto the Doctor. Thus, after they deliberately 'leaked' some information about the Doctor's recent malady, Sideroca poured all her energy and enthusiasm into taking care of the Doctor. Even with all of that, however, the reserve operators frequently see Sideroca laboring away on the training grounds.",

Its carver must have pictured that all those departing the city would read it the moment they lifted their heads. Now, though, stallkeeps and mercenaries throng the gate as tightly as packed fins, and those who look up will see nothing but smoke-stained graffiti and billboards. These used to be Sideroca's stomping grounds as a child—she'd watch aging mercs grumble as they waited to find employers, snippets of their words helping her piece together a map in her head—the map she'd use for her escape plan one day.\nIt's been years since then. She's returned, here beneath this gate once more. The branch director who'd referred Sideroca to Rhodes Island is here with her now, touring the old haunt together and talking about old times. The director confesses that back then, more than anything, she'd rushed to sign up Sideroca because she didn't want to let a talent like her go anywhere else. Sideroca had that little something extra compared to your average drifter. Real recognizes real, so to speak.\nA freight boat needs a ballast to sail, and the wandering mercs and merchants of this citadel need something spiritual to weigh down their legs, lest they be trapped behind the mountains. Sideroca was barely an adult when she found her legs, firmer ones than any merc drowning their life away in booze. So what did keep her so rock-steady?\nShe doesn't have an answer right away. She scrutinizes Corinia once more, this city built on the idea of an eye for an eye. She can't stand the place in all its dark, bloodied glory. It sickens her how the books you learn to read from here teach you all the different names of money. She despises how children play pretend by copying the way grown-ups haggle and bargain and use each other for their own gain. To her, Corinia is one giant example of what things shouldn't be. With every step, she's reminding herself: don't end up like this. Don't end up like the merchants who peddle fakes beneath the gate, or the mercs who cry ripoff and smash their stalls up.\nA crude rock can be carved into pillar decorations or boat ballasts. Yet, if you price it as a jewel and cling to it, you'll waste all your energy and sink to the river's bottom with it. The further Sideroca travels from her homeland, the more clearly she understands this and many other things.\nShe has no interest in entering the city itself. Just as she's about to go, the branch director asks if she's ever seen how that inscription has a second half:\n'For thy countless paths begin from here.'"
