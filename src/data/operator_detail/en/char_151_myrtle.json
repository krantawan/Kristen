THANK YOU.\nCONTACT: Myrtle\n(A handwritten addendum follows.)\nDurin says this doesn't actually tell anyone what I lost, so I should add some details about the treasure.\nDESCRIPTION: Tiny, thin card, my name written on it, usually kept in a beautiful card holder. Best thing I ever got on the surface.\n(Handwriting changes color at this point.)\nHow can no one have seen my treasure or my vault? Impossible! But Durin says I have to write about it.\nEvery child of First Avenue keeps a vault where they stow their valuables away. For example, a door bolt you can use as a gun. (The evil neighbors on the commercial street started copying that, the scoundrels.) As Generalissimo of First Avenue and Third Commercial, my collection was naturally the richest, enough to move anyone who saw it, not to mention the fine collection from the surface...\nDurin stole my pen just now. Said I write too much about nothing and to get to the point. Who cares about her! Why isn't she asleep yet?\nEXAMPLE FROM COLLECTION: Tablecloth that never ever gets dirty (my first treasure). Apparently made of materials my dad invented. Paint and draw all you want and it stays clean. Mysterious! I had to listen to my dad go on forever before I understood how it worked. It looks a lot like a flag, so I decided I would campaign everywhere with it. People back home teased me about it, but it stands witness to my great journey as Generalissimo. I didn't think twice before taking it with me to the surface.\nMy lost treasure is about on par with that tablecloth.\n(Newer handwriting follows, ink still wet.)\nIt's not about the apple! Yes, the apple is a treasure too, but I didn't lose it, I loaned it to Engineering!\nADDITIONAL SUPPLEMENT! The missing treasure was the first thing I obtained when I came aboard, and the operators said it marked me as a member of Rhodes Island. I didn't put any stock in it at first, but came to find that that's just how great Rhodes is: there are new things all over, the operators are wonderful and listen to what I have to say and trust my talent as a generalissimo, and I can be of help to everyone too. And most importantly, nobody laughs at my flag, and the Doctor loves it!\nI'm very happy at Rhodes Island, and that thing has become important to me, and now a treasure.\nI hope that finally clear things up.\n......\n'Myrtle, would that treasure you lost happen to be your... work ID?'\n'That does ring a bell or three... oooohhh, I remember! Yes, that's it!'\n'Um... isn't it right there on your chest, then?'\n'Huh?!'"
