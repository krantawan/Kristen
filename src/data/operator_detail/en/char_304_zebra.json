Nonetheless, because of his lazy personality, most operators don't tend to associate him with what they consider soldiers. The fact that Spot has himself admitted to leaving the Sargon army because he wanted to get away from military life certainly doesn't help. Therefore, Heavyrain might just be a better example of a Sargon soldier than Spot.\nAnd while most people tend to forget Heavyrain's background as a soldier because of her bashful nature in their daily interactions, the moment she steps on the battlefield, her professional combat training is immediately apparent to any observers. Be it assessing the battlefield or executing the orders she is given, she is capable of carrying out the task on hand well without letting her personal views getting in the way. In Instructor Dobermann's words, 'If you're looking for a professional soldier, look no further than Heavyrain.'\nThat being said, Heavyrain is far from flawless.\nHer shortcoming is particularly noticeable when her allies are injured or otherwise in danger. She becomes fretful and anxious and displays a level of aggressiveness not normally seen in her; this further causes her to lose her calm and ability to analyze her surroundings effectively.\nThis is not a fatal flaw, as she can usually regain her calm in a relatively short period of time as long as her commanding officer knows how to work with her. Yet the problem still remains. Owing to this, Heavyrain was assigned as a Defender operator by Instructor Dobermann. Furthermore, Instructor Dobermann has requested her to adopt a combat style that is practically entirely foreign to her. That is her main responsibility on the battlefield now—To defend her allies.",

However, because of her withdrawn personality, she wasn't able to develop a good relationship with most of her fellow soldiers. In the end, there was only a single person who befriended her.\nHowever, during a confrontation with another Lord Ameer, Heavyrain found herself betrayed by her one and only friend. As it turns out, the friend had been planning on using her as a stepping stone to join the enemies.\nHer entire squadron was wiped out in a single skirmish while her friend defected to the enemy Lord Ameer with information about their side. She alone was spared only to be used as a scapegoat for the chaos that unfolded.\nBecause of her aloofness, she was left without any support in the army, and she was almost sentenced to death by the military court, only finding herself spared thanks to the testimony of a survivor who managed to escape.\nThe betrayal had left her disillusioned, and, in the end, she used her accomplishments in the army to buy herself the opportunity to leave, becoming a mercenary thereafter.\nHowever, the incident has left her even more sensitive than before. As a result, she found herself repeatedly running up the wall, and this eventually led her here to Rhodes Island.",

The army's oppressive environment has only served to put even more pressure on her, leaving her unsure of how to express herself. At the same time, it has also made her willing to trust anyone who shows her even the tiniest bit of goodwill.\nAlthough Rhodes Island is home to operators with vastly different personalities, many of them are accepting of others. Heavyrain's introversion has hardly kept these operators from forming a friendship with her. Therefore, Heavyrain thinks of every last operator who has shown her a smile as someone she must repay with her very life, which is why she loses control of herself on the battlefield—she cares about them way too much, and she will not tolerate anyone hurting her friends.\nSuch a cute reason for someone so berserk.\nMost of our operators realize that Heavyrain doesn't know how to express herself, but they most likely have never imagined that Heavyrain thinks that, for the kindheartedness they have extended to her, she should naturally repay the favor.\nThat said, adorable as it may be, we must remember that this mentality is unhealthy. Heavyrain herself knows as well, but she evidently doesn't know how to correct it.\nFortunately, the Doctor is at the top of the list of people whose kindness she must repay.\nThe time she has spent with the Doctor since her onboarding has clearly left Heavyrain very trustful of, if not outright dependent on, the Doctor, who has undoubtedly already come to understand this aspect of Heavyrain. Surely, the Doctor will be able to guide her on the right path and slowly help her learn to express her emotions and manage her relationships with others.",

I could never lay a hand on you, even if it was an order!'\n—Taken from Vol. 9, Ch. 6 of the comic book Field Raider\n\nWhen the fresh-aboard-the-landship, former soldier of Sargon shrinks into a nook to read her comics, it's usually all quiet.\nBut today seems a little out of the ordinary. The other operators in the lounge all heard the stifled yet clear sobs, yet are surprised to find Heavyrain, comic book in hand, buried in a sofa in the lounge's corner—and yes, in tears.\nThis unusual situation leads them to discuss in private.\n\n'Is there anything in that comic worth crying over?'\n'Dunno. I always thought that series had kinda crappy art.'\n'Then why...?'\n'Y'know, why not just ask her directly?'\n'Wait, wait! Hey, what if you end up touching a nerve?!'\n'Then what's your idea?'\n'I've got a plan.'\n\nMaybe due to having his reading time interrupted, Spot, original owner of the comic he lent Heavyrain, yawns as he gets up, walks over, and pats her on the shoulders as she continues to cry.\n'This comic's—'\nSpot speaks very, very slowly. '—MC turns into a superhuman who singlehandedly blocks cannons by the end, and none of his team die. Apparently the one who betrayed them was a double agent who couldn't tell anyone about it, and every enemy gets redemption and surrenders one by one.'\nThe emotionless Spot continues, 'After the volume you're holding, the plot just falls apart.'\n\nHeavyrain stops crying, her expression gone completely blank upon hearing spoilers far too convoluted for her turbulent emotions.\n'So... the lead protects everyone, and his friend... didn't betray him?'\nHeavyrain slowly shuts the comic.\nIt really is a sloppy plot. So sloppy and trite, her head hurts like a shield just took a whack at her brain.\n\nBut still...\nIt's a story. What's so bad about a happy ending where everyone's together?\nAnd blocking cannons singlehandedly—k-kind of sounds a bit cool.",
