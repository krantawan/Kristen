To ensure their survival, the people of this settlement delved into their natural talents at evading Catastrophes and cultivating crops. Podenco has been interested in a variety of plants since a young age, likes to make dried flowers, and also tended a small nursery back home. As she grew up, she became involved in the community's farming efforts, gaining rich experience in botanical cultivation for plants both edible and ornamental. When asked which type of plants she prefers, Podenco will quietly tell you that she likes flowers more, but when food and clothing become a scarcity, she will silently stash away her personal preferences deep into her heart.",

She couldn't wait to find some place filled with fragrance and beauty, and soon after, she bumped into Perfumer in the middle of the street. Perfumer immediately noticed Podenco's fondness for flowers, and her own Garden happened to be short of the personnel needed to make her aromatherapy raw materials. And just like that, Podenco ran into someone by mistake, and landed herself the first job of her life. \nCompared to Perfumer, Podenco still is lacking in many ways. Her sense of smell isn't as sensitive as Perfumer's, nor does she have any knowledge of auxiliary professions, but she is quickly approaching Perfumer's skill with the momentum she has. From a single flower, to a garden, and now to an entire greenhouse, Podenco has the skill to independently manage the Convalescent Garden. In addition, she also began to use the flowers she collected to create a wide variety of reagents, constantly adapting to meet the demands of the various medics in the medical facility. In time, she may well become the world's undisputed master of horticulture. \nAnd it all stems from her love for flowers. \nA lifelong love.",

The doctors say it's because of overwork and so on, so I have to recuperate, and I'm not allowed to go and look after the plants. That's why I need you to take over some of the Convalescent Garden's work. I'll write what you need to do underneath, and if you're not sure about anything, you can ask Miss Lena to teach you. I'll recover as soon as I can, so I won't keep you for too long.\nBefore I introduce the work to you, please take a look to the right of this letter. There's a pouch with floral teabags, and some tasty little snacks. They're all for you, to say thank you. Go on and have them while you read below.\n\nYour daily work will involve the following:\n1. Temperature logging and warning. Each greenhouse entrance has a terminal to control the thermoregulatory equipment. You just need to check each day if the figures are normal or not, that's all. If the equipment's giving a warning, then report it to Miss Lena as soon as possible, and she'll help you solve the problem.\n2. Operating the lighting. The Garden's lighting systems are all unified under PRTS control, so you don't actually need to worry too much, but just in case it's not working properly, you'll need to operate them manually, and adjust them into the correct positions. I've drawn detailed directions on another sheet, so make sure you look over that carefully.\n3. Plant irrigation. You can leave most of the plants alone, and the greenhouse will sprinkle them at the same times each day. The schedule should be stuck to the door, so don't go inside when that's happening. There's some other flowers too, the ones in my studio, and I'm really sorry, but all I can do is ask you to take care of them for the time being. I've labelled how much water and nutritional fluid every plant needs on their pots, so keep a close eye on the markings on the spray bottle, and don't give them too much.\n......\nThat's all I wanted to tell you. Once again, thank you for finding the time in your busy schedule to help me. If you like the presents I left you, then I promise I'll make more for you once I'm back in shape.\n\n\n—Podenco"
