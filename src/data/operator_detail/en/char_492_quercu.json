She enjoys being outside, can skillfully climb trees with her bare hands, can distinguish the different scents of flowers and cries of fowlbeasts upon the wind, and claims that the closed-off environment of the Rhodes Island landship makes it hard for her to breathe. As for her Originium Arts, while they are able to mend wounds, they are also able to make seeds grow quickly into vines, or make weeds sprout along distant mountain roads. This procedure is usually accompanied by a ceremonial language with no discernable effect. According to her, in her tradition this is known as a dialogue with the land.\nThough her Originium Arts can promote plant growth, Quercus will not use it to help save the wilted potted plants of other operators. 'While I could use my Originium Arts to revive your plants, that is not something the flowers ever wanted to show you. You'd better water them instead.'\n\n'There are no issues with Rhodes Island's circulation or ventilation systems. If Quercus is mentioned in any complaint about the air quality sent by other operators, the contents can be safely ignored. There's a high likelihood of it being a psychosomatic effect after listening to Quercus.'\n—Additional memo from an Engineering Department Operator",

Though she is primarily active in Victoria, this does not affect the fact that she maintains cordial relationships with many operators. This is largely due to her excellent memory: just by eating lunch with someone in the cafeteria, she'll instantly be able to recognize that person and call out their name, even after half a year. Additionally, each time she shows up at Rhodes Island, she always brings back a variety of gifts and local specialties, enough for all her friends. Strangers who partake of her gifts quickly become her friends too. Of course, if someone is overly enthusiastic about her preserved fruits, fresh flower cakes, or other handmade products, she'll remind them that 'bulk orders must be made in advance.' As a result, each time she contacts Rhodes Island, she tends to include some private information, such as 'the homemade fruit wine has fermented,' 'I've stored three crates of canned seasoned sandworms,' etc.\nWhile carrying out field missions abroad in Victoria, Quercus always has ways of turning her base into a popular spot for visitors. So far, she's tried setting up a flower shop, a jam bakery, and a co-op bookstore. Thanks to her cheerful and gentle image as a shopkeeper, all her business ventures have gone well, leading many to wonder if she's actually doing her job or just trying to live life to its fullest. Still, the contents of her reports have never given any cause for disappointment.\n...Has she gotten addicted to the city's hustle and bustle? It's almost as if she's terrified of empty places.",

Rhodes Island was newly established at the time and we were in need of helping hands. Though she wasn't Infected, she was still a benevolent doctor who treated the Infected as equals, while also displaying some professional combat prowess, so I tried reaching out to her.\nSomewhat to my surprise, she was not the dogmatic tribal healer I made her out to be, instead exhibiting an open-mindedness I rarely saw in the other locals. She candidly admitted that her traditional Originium Arts and herbal remedies were unable to treat many ailments.\nRhodes Island's hopes of treating Oripathy clearly appealed to her, and she provided the following conditions for her joining: she would not leave Victorian soil, she would not kill anyone in the line of work, and Rhodes Island would share its experiences of handling the Infected with her. I thought we would be able to meet all three of those conditions.\n\n—Rhodes Island Operator, Bitter Root\n\n[Classified Log]\nAccording to Operator Bitter Root, Quercus should have a history of military service.

However, when Rhodes Island obtained her Special Forces combat history during a background check, she spoke openly about a conflict that broke out in a Victorian enclave, clearly reciting the full names of every young soldier under her at the time.\nShe made no attempt to turn away from the fact that she would go on to lose all her comrades-in-arms during the ensuing battles, an all-too-common experience. In her own words, she was already well acquainted with death, being the only healer in her hometown. She is even glad she managed to survive to the end, and was thus able to sing lamentations for each and every one of those children, sending them off in a foreign land.\nWhile she did not explicitly admit to any regrets during the conversation, before she made the decision to join Rhodes Island she displayed an extremely cautious attitude, carefully inquiring about Rhodes Island's philosophy, course of action, and what we fought for. Presumably, she did not want to be deceived into taking up arms again. As for the young soldiers, who Quercus called 'children', they had apparently taken her rallying cries to heart, plunging into the conflict with full faith. While she returned home bitter and angry, they did not return home at all.\nIn response to her frankness, the HR operator answered her questions as thoroughly as possible. However, after signing her preliminary contract, she slyly asked the staff in charge of her onboarding: 'Since you don't need an army, what's the use of knowing that I was a soldier before?'\n\nWhile Operator Quercus has been genuine with Rhodes Island, her statement also rings true. As a mere commander of a squad, there was no way for her to understand the internal political struggles in Victoria underpinning that conflict. Rhodes Island can trust her, but also needs to avoid thrusting her into certain subjects of investigation.\n—HR Operator",

I'm filing to have bereavement paid to their families; the forms are attached to this report.\n(They were the youngest children in the squad. I recited farewell to them, so that they may find rest in these foreign soils. I believe, for my squad, that such a ritual must be done.)\n\n04 APR\nHaving not yet received further orders, my team has been laying bait as per the original plan, and locked onto a number of core enemy personnel as a result. Files are attached. We are ready to cut at the neck.\nWe expect to spend substantially longer in combat, so consumption of medical supplies will rise too. I'll dispatch a professional from the team to reexamine our contact channel; if the situation outside is dire, or the comms line is obstructed, she can provide you with some effective aid.\n\n10 APR\nI apologize for my rashness. After this is over, I will accept disciplinary action for my failure in this operation.\nMy team carried out a breakthrough under my command. I judged from meager information that other Victorian Army units had arrived at the enclave, and planned accordingly. We were required to make an opening for the ensuing force, carrying out our duty as an advance unit. Besides that, we had a shortage of supplies, so could not continue biding our time.\nAs the outcome shows, I made a grave lapse of judgment.\nI will record the callsigns and family names of each of the deceased.\nI pray this report arrives swiftly, and that we may receive our next orders.\n\n15 APR\nWe have successfully made contact with a force of the Redsteel Guard, and learned that other friendly forces are in fact present within the city; the news greatly heartens us. However, even they could not deliver us any valid orders.\nI apologize for the blood staining this paper; I am busy treating my wounded soldiers. There is no mission to report on here; this letter is simply... a plea for help. What exactly has happened on the outside?\n\n(dateless)\nI will be writing no further reports. I have no squad anymore.\nWhy has there been no reply? Why was our mission objective fake—our information too? Why did they have to die before their time?\nTo whoever receives this report—whoever—I DO NOT CARE WHO. I will not be returning to debrief at Command. The lives of those children weigh on me.
