The plastic imitation-tattoo one is her usual pick; it makes her neck look more slender. Most importantly, it's cheap—they come a literal dime a dozen.\n'Salary, y'know? I don't wanna splash salary. I have to rake that stuff in with my own poor cutesy hands.'\n'Rope, it's been ten minutes. Are you still not decided?'\n'Just gimme a tiny bit longer, pleaaase.'\n'I'm giving you ten more minutes. That's ten. Period.'\n'Gotcha!'\n'Man, I really like the other one too. Nawww. I super like it...'\nIn the box lies an exquisitely handmade leather choker, studded with limpid melee diamonds, somewhat at odds sat with the cheap and loud plastic product next to it.\nA few months ago, a fellow squad op gave Rope this choker as a present, as thanks for having her back in a desperate situation. Rope loves it. It's a treasure of hers, but never her pick. She used to loiter at the display window, making her reflection overlap with the pedestal behind the glass, and like moonlight shines on the water, this choker would sit around her neck. She'd flutter her eyes, and so would the girl in the glass, and in that moment they'd become one.\nBut unfortunately, reflections aren't forever.\n'I bet I looked way too desperate staring at it. I bet that's how she figured me out.'\n'Aw, it sucks so much. All the stuff I want but can't get, and now the only thing I get to do is daydream about it.'\n'Ugh—why'd I ever get on this pirate ship?!'\nShe dangles the choker in front of her nose, shuts her eyes and sniffs deeply at the leather's smoky scent. It's the fragrance of tar oil, picked up from its tanning phase.\n'Ahh, that's the smell of wealth—maybe I'll just wear this one for today. Then again, the leather's so soft. What if it gets scraped up?'\nRope cups the choker in her hands, and lightly rubs her cheeks against it, reveling in the sophisticated and sensual texture.\n'You're so comfy. I love you. Couldn't bear to wear you...'\n'It's been ten minutes! If you don't come out, I'm leaving you behind!'\nRope curls her lips, secretly showing her resentment at the voice nagging her from behind the door.\n'Coming!'\n'What are you even picking?'\n'I'm a girl going out! I've gotta pick out my shoes and outfit and jewelry just right.'\n'Your clothes look pretty much same as normal to me.'\n'You say that again and I'm gonna get mad.'\n'...Why aren't you wearing that choker I got you? Don't you like it?'\n'Of course I'm not. It's the good stuff. You've always gotta leave the good stuff for next time.'\n'Hrmph. I'd beg to differ.'"
