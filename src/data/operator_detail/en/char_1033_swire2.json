            "storyText": "Compared to before her promotion to L.G.D. Commissioner, Swire has had little opportunity to visit Rhodes Island, and the few visits she does make have been relatively shorter. In the Training Room, she often simply gives a few words of advice to the training operators, and completely dodges any mention of Lungmen when conversing our operators. At most she occasionally brings up the logistics company she and Bison founded together in Siesta, as well as her magnum opus there—the waterpark.\nBut ever since she was promoted to commissioner, she rarely seems to show up together with Operator Hoshiguma.\nSome veteran operators couldn't help but wonder if her promotion created a rift between the two, but every time the subject is brought up, she would suddenly get emotional and complain that although Hoshiguma seems like last person to mind such formalities, she'd always call her 'Commissioner Swire,' both in public and private. Even when the two of them happen to bump into each other at the elevators, Hoshiguma intentionally avoids her with a solemn expression, instead of accompanying her. This has left Swire dumbfounded. Although Hoshiguma has always dismissed this as a method to avoid arousing suspicion, Swire clearly did not accept this answer.\nOut of an abundance of caution, our operators now restrict the topics of their everyday conversations to Lungmen's dining scene. Supposedly, Swire recommends places ranging from local street stalls to high end restaurants with exorbitant prices. While on deployment in Lungmen, our operators sometimes catch her having late night snacks at the street stalls. They would merely wave at each other before going back to their meals, with the lights of the L.G.D. Commissioner's office illuminating the night sky in the distance.",

She also met up with Snowsant as she was returning from a field mission, told her she 'wanted the chief designer to participate in the ribbon cutting ceremony,' and shoved a few more designs into her hands while she was at it.\nUnder her leadership, her waterpark was successfully built to blueprint, and has proven to be no less exciting than the Obsidian Festival. It draws crowds of visitors with no end in sight, and there are even plans to expand. Thanks to this one trip, Snowsant managed to finally amass the funding she's been trying to obtain for years—as well as a multitude of design patents—while Swire and Bison have at last found their footing in Terra's cutthroat international logistics and trade industry.\nMountaincomm Trade is currently in a period of stable expansion, and their international business's success in Siesta has given the two young entrepreneurs the confidence to continue. Their next stop, Lungmen—Yan's most important commercial port—is also waiting to be taken to new heights. Though compared to their ultimate goal of connecting all the lands together, the two of them are merely taking a small step forward. However, this one, firm step has already roused the echoes of time.\n'What's the point in following the older generation's asses only to fight over what they leave behind? If I'm getting into business, I may as well break into a new market. I can do more than uphold the order in Lungmen. I have the power to build it.'\nThe many parties within the Lungmen Chamber of Commerce are even now bickering amongst themselves. Even the scaffolding used to build Siesta's new towers is covered with their corporations' names in large letters. Siesta is facing a transition, and so is Swire. And both have satisfactory answers to offer.",

He was elated, and he both approves of the Mountaincomm Trade business and has high expectations of you.'\n......\n'However, considering that you now hold an important position, it is paramount that you exercise prudence, maintain the appropriate demeanor, and refrain from making any ostentatious displays in public. This should go without saying. Now that your vacation is over, I must ask that you return to your duties at the L.G.D. with all haste.\n'Further, your grandfather's condition has been deteriorating by the day. He is eager to see his granddaughter. Please pay him a visit as soon as possible.'\n—Wei Yenwu\nAnother has beautiful handwriting, and even the paper itself gives off a pleasant aroma.\n'I heard that your grandfather coughed up blood and fainted while watching your childhood tapes. I visited him in the hospital, but he was asleep. The doctor wasn't very optimistic about his condition.\n'I know you two have never gotten along, but blood is thicker than water. There must be something he wants to tell you before he goes. Stop playing around all day and come back to see him as soon as you can. Think of it as giving yourself closure. You owe yourself that much. Don't end up regretting your decisions.'\n—Lin Yühsia\nAnother letter has strokes as heavy as the first, though its handwriting is much cruder. The sender also practically dove towards Swire with the letter.\n'Nei zek laan taan mao, I heard you pissed nei ah je off so much that he just up and zau maai?!'\n—Hoshiguma\n\nSwire held Hoshiguma down, and then continued her journey to Lungmen.\nThe conversation in that extravagant sickroom between Swire and Old Mr. Schwire, her grandfather, will forever remain a secret to everyone else. However, the moment she closed the door, a satisfied laugh could be heard in the hallway, creeping through the door.\nA few months later, Swire, his heir apparent, announced she would leave the Schwire Group. That afternoon, she attended the Lungmen Guard Department's promotion ceremony and was promoted to the role of commissioner—the police chief.",

When the last senior superintendent left, she didn't take any of her belongings with her. This time, Swire put them all away in a paper box labeled with the name of their owner: Ch'en Hui-chieh.\n\nCatalogue of Desktop Items\nCh'en Hui-chieh:\nFelt-tip pen, previous years' documents pertaining to the Lungmen Infected, water cup.\nSwire:\nBusiness contract, letter from Lin, evidence bag, L.G.D. holiday attendance schedule, police work policy adjustment suggestions, situation analyses...\nAlso a bowl of finball soup, still hot; I'll bring it over in a moment.\n\nThe officers sometimes privately discuss how Swire's leadership compares to Ch'en's. Superintendent Ch'en always led the charge, and always capably divvied up the tasks among everyone. Those who worked under her would breathe a long sigh after missions and find themselves unable to loosen up for the better part of a day. On the other hand, Swire requires everyone to handle multiple tasks at once, but all the officers agree that, even at their most busy, the work is never unmanageable. No matter how many problems there are, they can always feel a clear through line in their work. This line threads together every problem and reaches the core of it all. But long story short, 'It's like both of them have eight brains each. If I were in their position, I'd be dead the first day on the job.'\nAside from her work at the L.G.D., Mountaincomm Trade, which Swire founded with Bison, has expanded rapidly from only a small factory in a corner of Lungmen, allowing the city to gain an even firmer foothold in Terra's international trade as Yan's premier city of commerce. Lungmen's public order and economy are both undergoing rapid development. Swire still sits in her office, and her desk is just as messy and cluttered as before, but no one would ever claim that she got where she is because of the Schwire Group's backing, or that she took over for somebody. She is where she deserves to be, and is doing a terrific job, too.\n\n'Young Ch'en's chase may have guided her onto a different path, but it's clear that this girl is a better fit for the role... The kids have their own paths to walk, and they're all well on their way now. Remember how you were worried sick all those years ago? Now you'll admit they're capable, right?'\n'She is indeed doing a fine job. I can rest easy knowing the L.G.D. is in her capable hands.'\n'You should watch your back, though. She might even be eyeing your Lungmen Chief seat.'\n'She'll have to work much harder for it, then. Us old bones aren't THAT old yet—Hey, your beard got in my bowl!'\n—A casual conversation between two old men drinking tea in Lungmen's night market",

Hoshiguma asks curiously, poring over the Columbian on the certificate.\n'The greatest activity a business can undertake is connecting with the future'—I'm putting that in my autobiography.'\n'This certificate really tells a wild story... And you managed to do all this in just under two months? What does 'opened up international markets' mean exactly?'\n'Siesta's coffee beans were moving slow this year, so I made a few friends and sold off a massive shipment to Kazimierz—did you want to try some? I still have some in my bag.'\n'And can you translate 'an attitude that shows they care about the human side of things'?'\n'I did a little investing, and got the volcanic hot springs there transformed into a waterpark. Everyone seemed to take quite a liking.'\n'Okay, and 'a mindset for acute initiative' refers to...'\n'There were an awful lot of firms warring for Siesta's urban construction. Winning the final bid obviously took doing a little something to stand out.'\n'So how did you win?'\n'On vacation. Which is where that story is staying.'\n'Uh-huh...'\n'Stop reading that and help me sort my gifts out. This surfboard is for you, here's a volcanic mud cleanser for that stinky rat, here's a vinyl for that puk gaai lung—you know what, she can fetch it herself when she gets back—and here's some fruit cans for old Wei...'\nThe two spend all afternoon sorting through the pile of memorabilia, until finally, the only thing left lying forlornly on the ground is that medal.\n'Are you putting this on display? I don't know, your cabinet's already full with all your other awards...'\n'Forget it, this one can be a present for that sick old tiger—I'm visiting the hospital tomorrow, so I'll just give it to him myself.' Swire puts the medal away in her handbag, then stretches delightedly.\n'As the representative of Lungmen's future, I'm going to go connect with him.'",

You guys have to try their new poon choi. It's made traditionally, but the ingredients come from a new trade route that Mountaincomm Trade just opened. You'll get flavors from Rim Billiton to Sargon, and it's all super fresh. It even comes with a bottle of wine from Sami!\nSwire: Bison and I worked really hard to get this supply line up and running, so you all have to come! @Stinky Rat\nStinky Rat: Am I invited?\n17:09\nGuma: i'm starving. can we just go now?\nSwire: There aren't any seats yet. Have a snack to tide you over!\n18:32\nGuma: so hungry...\n19:20\nGuma: starving...\n19:58\nStinky Rat: Something just came up. You guys eat first.\n20:08\nSwire: Huh?\nSwire: What about Hoshiguma?\n20:23\nSwire: It's been ages since we all last met up—we HAVE to eat together. Finish up whatever it is you're doing, then decide where we're going to eat!\n20:41\nSwire: So, what are we gonna eat?\n21:19\nSwire: What are we eating tonight???\nSwire: Lin Yühsia, I can see you on read! Hurry up and pick a place!\nStinky Rat: I just finished up. Besides, you're the one who put out that 'Director Swire's Lungmen Food Guide'. It's been blaring nonstop on TV for three days. And I'm the one that has to pick the restaurant?\nGuma: sorry, emergency mission. done now. i'll eat whatever, as long as there's meat. i'm so hungry i could eat a burdenbeast\nStinky Rat: How about the night market? 'Right next to the shopping district, featuring specialty items from all over Terra. Shop at all of Terra, only in Lungmen!' Pretty good marketing copy, don't you think?\nSwire: Great choice! I have to promote my work, after all!\nGuma: doesn't sound like much meat. pass\nSwire: The volcanic mud cleansing face mask I gave you is on sale there too, @Stinky Rat. And the surfboard @Guma.\nSwire: Bison and I bargained day and night, and now they cost almost the same as they do in Siesta. Smart, huh?\nGuma: don't wanna eat a surfboard\nStinky Rat: How about the Global Commerce Park? It's second on your food guide list.\nSwire: That could work. We're working to attract investors over there, and we have a lot of international vendors now. The food's good too.\nGuma: i want meat, and that's over half an hour away. i'll starve on the way\nSwire: Well that's a shame. Young folks love that place—it's a top date spot!\nStinky Rat: Enough!\nStinky Rat: Final offer: the noodle cart behind the L.G.D. station. If that's no good, you two can starve.\nGuma: fine by me\nSwire: Fine by me.\n21:30\nSwire: Wait, Lin Yühsia, how did you get my food guide? Weren't you complaining about my TV ads?\nStinky Rat: I just grabbed one. Is that a problem?\n21:33\nStinky Rat: How come the noodle cart isn't on your food guide?\nSwire: I wanted to include it, but the owner refused. He said something about how he didn't want his humble stall to be viewed as a sellout and lose its authenticity.\nSwire: Which is great, in my opinion. In the end, that's what Lungmen is all about.\n21:38\nGuma: i've already ordered. hurry up\n23:35\nGuma: why hasn't chen read a single message?\nSwire: Try the intercity net. She's probably standing on a pile of hay in the middle of nowhere, holding up her terminal to catch a signal.\n—New Message—\nPuk Gaai Lung: ...\nPuk Gaai Lung: It's a pile of rocks.\nPuk Gaai Lung: I'm back in Lungmen.
