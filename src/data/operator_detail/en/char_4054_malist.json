From Durin's clumsiness and Myrtle's energy, to Chestnut's down-to-earth attitude, our operators had wonderful illusions about the Durin. That is, until they met Minimalist.\nThough Gavial says he's much more approachable than he used to be, Minimalist continues to occasionally do things that make his colleagues speechless. These include suddenly showing up in a room to critique the interior design, submitting 80 applications to renovate his quarters in a single month, and most characteristically, insisting that he is kept clean and tidy from head to toe. No matter how urgent the situation, his pencil must be wiped clear of dust and secured behind his ear, lest it bump into any corner of his body. Every time he does this, the medic who completed the handover with Gavial's team on the initial field mission would put on an expression that says, 'I told you so.'\nOn the other hand, Minimalist's talent for design is beyond question. His interior design proposals are simple but effective, and many have reluctantly admitted that they have gained useful inspiration from his incessant nagging. As for the positive side of his personality, there are no (MISSING RECORD)\n\nAttachment 1:\nI'm sorry. I should not overwrite other people's documents.

For example, while other operators might seek help from more experienced colleagues when they run into trouble, Minimalist would mull over it on his own without speaking to anyone. He knows he should ask for help, but would instead drag things on for days. And when he finally makes a decision, the state of his hair will reflect the scale of the issue as he goes off on various unrelated tangents until he finally, reluctantly, talks about the problem.\nSome operators have reported this to Closure: when helping someone else with a design, he struts like a fowlbeast that caught a dozen slugs that morning, but he has great difficulty asking for help when he runs into trouble himself. Perhaps it is a matter of pride—which is not a bad thing for a designer—but Minimalist needs to learn that anyone can run into problems, no matter how good they are, and that he should accept that rather than deny it.\n'He can be pretty docile in that state. After you help him, follow up with a few words, and he'll do much better the next time.' —Unnamed Engineering Operator",

He did his best with the time he had, left the city where he grew up in slumber, and awoke to the sights and sounds of Acahualla. Most of the former residents of Zeruertza stayed with the tribespeople and began to build a new home, while Minimalist and a few other Infected came to Rhodes Island for treatment.\nHe rarely brings up Zeruertza, nor does he display much in the way of homesickness. Like many other former Zeruertzans, Minimalist's outlook is optimistic, believing that they will find a new home. He cannot help but feel a pang of regret, however, that the recognition that he finally earned must be buried underground, never again to see the light of day. At first, he wanted to help rebuild the new home. Whatever time he had left, he would use it, as the current Design Representative, to help the people of Zeruertza build a sustainable city. The plan eventually fell through, not because the Zeruertzans did not want to burden him with the responsibility, but because most of them were too busy enjoying their new lives on the surface to work together. So he accepted Gavial's proposal, and traveled to Rhodes Island to receive treatment for his Oripathy, somewhat to his chagrin.\nMinimalist looked back at the rainforest on the day he departed. Lightrace had left to find his teacher, and the Zeruertzans had begun to build a scattering of temporary dwellings. Minimalist told Gavial that he expected his trip to Rhodes Island to be temporary, that someday, he'd return to build a home that everyone would be happy with.",

The Engineering Department hoped that the assignment would improve his approach, while also making preparations in case anything unexpected came up. As expected, Minimalist's face fell when he saw the storage space, but he surprisingly refrained from the long tirade that he might have went on under normal circumstances. Instead, he calmly accepted the assignment, and began working on a draft. One month later, Minimalist submitted a design that far exceeded expectations: the space was thoroughly reorganized, and areas previously wasted were put to good use. He went around the various departments that used the items kept there, working out their optimal method of storage, and discussing the design with other engineers. Each iteration took less and less time, the entire process went smoothly, and he was in good spirits.\nMinimalist did not explain the surprising result, only expressing that he is enjoying designing on his own now because he wanted to see his teacher again, and to show them that he is strong, independent, and at peace.\nWe do not understand what happened between Minimalist and his teacher, or how Gavial changed him, but at least he seems to be in a good place right now. In one instance, when Minimalist realized that he had not felt pain for a while after undergoing treatment, he opened a barrel of Zeruertza berry tomato wine for the first time and enjoyed it in his quarters, feeling that time has slowed down, and that he had begun to understand why his fellows want to enjoy life to the fullest.\nSince then, a change can be observed in Minimalist's designs: his quarters, for example, have begun to incorporate more gentle lines and colors other than white, as well as furniture with what he used to call 'meaningless' and 'aesthetically unsound' features.\nIn Gavial's words, they are finally suitable for habitation.",

Minimalist never stopped complaining, but nevertheless decorated the activity room per Myrtle's instructions, all flowery and stuff.\nAs more and more people arrived, some of them got drunk on fruit wine—I won't say who brought it—and they began to dress each other up with the flowers in the room, in the style of a certain Durin festival. That's what happened to Minimalist, and Myrtle and Chestnut were the main culprits. They did an amazing job, let me tell you, and surprisingly Minimalist never got mad. He ended up joining in the fun, jumping all over the place to put flowers into other people's hair.\nLike I said, I guess deep down, he actually loved it!",

He'd rather jump off the ship than turn in this design for a New Zeruertzan landmark as it is!\nHe averts his eyes from it as fast as he can. Like it or not, he made that model himself, and it burns him—it leers at him. <i>What now, proud architect?</i> Tasking him with 'fun' was an exercise in self-defeat.\n'I can't do it.'\nCan't he defend his dignity in any way? He dithers in circles, growing all the more agitated. No, now he feels like he's being lassoed along. He once chased after his departed 'design representative' with all the same agitation, and the harder he held on, the harder that title threatened to tear him in two. Like his right leg, the responsibility stung relentlessly: a reminder of how short his life was, how every standstill was a step forever lost.\nHe can't stop now.\nHe roots around everywhere he can, dying for some flash of inspiration to save him. Sketches fly into the air, models tumble to the ground, and still... still no eureka moment. He claws at his head in annoyance, and then, he comes face to face with the very last thing in the room.\nA barrel of berry tomato wine.\nFrom Catch. His fellow Durin are all big drinkers—where they're concerned, booze and fun more or less go hand in hand. Still, he recalls his mentor languidly staring out the window at the dome from time to time, sitting with a glass at the table.\nHe resists the idea, but the thought of trying is hard to stifle once it surfaces. He strains to pry the barrel open, then fills a glass. The scent of it actually stuns him for a moment. His reflection in it ripples with memory.\n'If you're curious, you may as well try.'\nHe did as his mentor said, accepting the bottle proffered and pouring the entire thing. The fierce bite of it made him dizzy, threatening to write off the rest of his workday. He scratched at the tiny rocks on his right leg as hard as he could, just hoping the pain would keep him sober still.\nBut his mentor laughed at that.\n'Enjoying life is our finest trait, and what we founded our homeland on. You're no exception, Stitch. You'll understand one day.'\nHearing that voice from long ago wakes him back up. He's startled to find himself reclining carefree in his chair, glass in hand just like Catch and his mentor and all the other Durin, quietly gazing out the cabin window. He subconsciously moves to scratch at his leg's stones, but his hand freezes.\nHe has no throbbing pain beneath the stones. He didn't feel it when he eyed the wine barrel. He hasn't felt it for a long, long time now.\n'Gavial, finally! He's been hiding in his studio forever!'\n'Alright, alley-oop—'\nThe door bursts open, and Gavial's fist stops just a finger's width from his nose.\n'Gavial? Perfect timing. Take me to the Medical Department—it's time for my treatment. What are you all staring at?'\nGavial gawks at the model rec facilities on the table behind him, a simple and surefire crowd-pleaser. Also, the bare and empty glass. It all clicks in her head, and a smile creeps onto her face.\n'Gavial! Why are you hitting me? I was NOT drinking before my appointment! I poured it all back!'",
