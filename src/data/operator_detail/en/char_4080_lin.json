Although he has always looked out for Rhodes Island whenever we made indirect contact, his daughter has now come directly to us to propose the establishment of a channel to facilitate trading medicine between the slums and Rhodes Island, and even considered having us station medical operators there while bypassing official channels. This is on a whole other level. It was a letter from Operator Ch'en that finally made us agree to this headache of a cooperation agreement.\nDisregarding some of the passages that lean more toward her personal feelings, the letter's message is clear: As an individual, she personally trusts Miss. Lin Yühsia, and, as an operator, she recommends that Rhodes Island accept this invitation.\n'Trust can be betrayed, but not mutual interest. And when it comes to the treatment of the Infected, Rhodes Island and I share the same interests.' Miss. Lin Yühsia gave us this frank explanation of our cooperation. Regardless, Rhodes Island's standpoint as a medical company and its contradictory ideal of working towards solving the Infected problem will not change. Just as she said, we currently have no reason to refuse.\n'Oh, right. If she says anything about <i>mutual interest</i> and <i>trust</i>, just ignore all that. She can be pretty shy.' —Ch'en notes at the end of her letter.",

We can always have faith in her ability to handle all sorts of affairs: she helps us sign highly advantageous business contracts at an extremely efficient pace, as well as removing without a trace certain enemies who harangue us. When probed, she also refused to tell us how exactly she handle these problems.\nTo an organization like Rhodes Island, a partnership like this isn't going to last. However, not only did Ch'en vouch for her, Swire, the current L.G.D. Superintendent, also continues to have a tacit trust in Miss. Lin. Swire may always say 'I'll personally arrest Miss Lin one day,' that's merely something she <i>says</i>. Evidently, the three of them have a close relationship, but they also never see each other aboard Rhodes Island. A peculiar relationship that piques all onlookers' interest. All things considered, as long as Rhodes Island's core objective remains the same, we can maintain our mutual trust and partnership. Indeed, this is how we generally operate with most other operators, and many of them go on to become true allies fighting toward the same goal.\nLet us trust her for the time being.\n\n[Classified Log]\n'What's this document?'\n'Information. These are the records of each and every Infected Rhodes Island has come across in the Lungmen slums the last couple years, their health condition afterwards, and their current social credit reports. And the transaction records of every Oripathy-related medication that Rhodes Island sells in Lungmen.\n'This is the reason I made Rhodes Island this partnership offer.'\n'You mean... you've been paying close attention to us ever since that incident?'\n'It's a necessary precaution, and it's also to make sure nothing like that happens in Lungmen ever again.'\n'You understand the consequences your information could bring.'\n'Which is why I made sure that no one else could possibly get their hands on any of it when I was gathering it.'\n'In that case, why are you handing this over to Rhodes Island now?'\n'To show my sincerity.'",

Our indirect dealings with her, as well as all the secrets we've heard from our sources, also more or less painted the image of her as a triad leader. Yet it was only when we finally met Miss. Lin in the flesh on board Rhodes Island that we found out she was not quite the dangerous, gloomy person that we imagined her to be.\nOn the contrary, most operators who have worked with her tell us that she is very easy to get along with. There was even one who, unaware of all the details, mistook her for medical staff from a Lungmen hospital. Indeed, outside of work, Lin never makes shows of force, and she is very well-versed in etiquette when interacting with others. Compared to her Lungmenite compatriots, the ever-meticulous Ch'en and the swift and decisive Officer Swire, Lin instead appears calm and composed, and she is often praised as the perfect embodiment of the elegance and dignity that foreign operators attribute to the Yanese. That said, her self-control and politeness may also have inadvertently distanced her from others even more.\nOccasionally, Miss. Lin Yühsia also displays an awe-inspiring expertise in the arts. Specifically, this includes her skills in Yanese calligraphy and painting, her unique viewpoints on interior design, as well as her mastery of tea ceremony, which eclipses even that of Lee. The glassware she crafts with her Originium Arts are all produced to the highest standards in both detail and design. Of course, to know all this about her, you would have to have built a certain level of rapport with her. If you are lucky enough and just so happen to have the opportunity to have a conversation with her while she is free, you will certainly be astounded by her deep knowledge of Yanese art history. The devotion and confidence she exudes as she discusses such topics show that she did not hone her techniques and eloquence merely for mingling in social settings. She truly loves them.\nGiven all this, we can't help but wonder: If she have never become the 'Lin' she now is, what sort of person would she have become?",

After getting her answer, she pondered briefly before writing 'Lin' down on the form.\nFrom what we understand about Lungmen, the name 'Lin' no doubt carries significant weight in the slums. Although very few have met the Rat King, or Lin Gray, in the flesh, the name itself is the embodiment of his order.\nAnd now Miss. Lin has chosen to inherit that name.\nWe learned of the 'Yumen Incident' and its gist from Operators Waai Fu and Lee's testimony. Based on this, we are certain that the commotion will have little direct effect on Rhodes Island or Lungmen, and thus Miss. Lin approaching us at this timing is more likely to be her own personal decision. Although no doubt there are deeper motivations to it, we won't dig any further.\nFrom the start, Miss. Lin's goal in forming a partnership with Rhodes Island could not have been clearer. The Infected problem is one of the main issues that the Lungmen slums face, but that is not the whole picture. 'My father built the slums in the first place because he hoped it would become something like a hazmat suit to Lungmen, but a lot of men out there want the slums to become an airtight bag instead.' As guests that have resided in Lungmen for some years now, we have a decent idea of many of the complicated and deeply rooted contradictions that Miss. Lin often speaks of. But regardless of the circumstances, she has always faithfully adhered to her promise and never involved Rhodes Island in problems unrelated to Oripathy.\nOn a certain level, given that we walk the same path—or at the very least, we are business partners that share the same goal—we've caught glimpses of her downplayed attitude as she dealt with the mafias who ignored the law of the land, her chilling aura as she negotiated with the Chamber of Commerce, and the profound grief she's shown as she discussed the problems that the slums face. That is more than enough for us to cast aside our suspicions and work wholeheartedly toward our common goal.\nWhere there is light, there is also a shadow. This is the unchanging truth. Just as there are those who stand in the light and use their authority to deny the existence of shadows, there are those who walk into the shadows in an attempt to light a lantern, and this is exactly the reason. She truly belongs in this city.",

      "desc": "The night is giving way, and the streetlamps are going out one by one. The only light left hangs in front of a food cart on the side of the street, swaying and flickering, steam drifting up beneath it. The vendor sits by his wok, face hidden behind the steam. He sees a customer in the distance, and stands to raise himself up a little.\n'You haven't been by in forever, Miss.'\n'I'm finally freed up.'\n'You're a busy person. I see you passing through this street every day, but you never sit yourself down here.'\n'One bowl of cart noodles. Oil noodles, curry base, two finballs to top.\n'Got it.'\nThe customer picks herself a spot close to the stovetop, and leisurely seats herself. The cart vendor turns around, stooped over like a fin stranded on land. He ladles out soup to boil the noodles, and chops up the meat, movements fluid and natural.\n'You're still open so late. Looks like business is good.'\n'All by grace of the Rat King... well, used to be. Now it's by yours, Miss. Back when I was apprenticing, no one would dare open at this hour.'\n'Is your medicine still enough?'\n'I've got ways to buy it, and I've never dared stop. I'll get sick if I'm not careful, and that'll be a hassle for you.'\n'No, look after yourself. If you <i>do</i> fall sick, that's far more hassle for you than me.'\n'It's out of you and your father's hands I picked my life back up... The fact you'd sit here to eat noodles means you think enough of me.'\n'My dad's goal has always been for everyone to live good lives—'\n*thunk*—\nWithin the rhythm of the kitchen knife and chopping board lands a heavy, muffled noise, promptly breaking off the subject.\n'Sorry to scare you, Miss... The new smith here does shoddy work. There used to be a smith next door, went by 'Cleavers Leong.' The knives he sharpened cut fast and shone light. Lovely to use.'\n'What happened to him?'\n'Died. Five years ago, he did.'\n'Five years. And people still think about him. He must've been a good man.'\n'Not all that good... You could count on him, but he never held back. Never changed his mind. He made one mistake, that's all it took.'\n'A very serious mistake to make.'\n'You and the Rat King both see right through us. You're smart. Us people below, we're dumb. Sometimes, unwise. You'll be needing to teach us a long time more, Miss.'\n'You'd listen to me, still?'\n'I thank you that you didn't ask how he died, Miss.'\n'You still blame me.'\n'I've said it already. My life comes from out of your hands. No sense in the blame game.'\n'......'\n'Your noodles are done, Miss.'\nThe vendor carefully carries the bowl over to the customer, and doesn't move away after setting it down—he stands and watches her devour the noodles clean, mouthful by mouthful. After she's done, she pulls the cash out from her bag and places it on the counter.\n'No need for change.'\n'The streets are tricky at night. Take your time, Miss.'\n'No need to worry, I can see clearly.'\n'No, you'd better be careful. Us little folk, we need you. We need someone to follow.'\n'It's late. Go on home.'\n'Miss...\n'I don't have the guts to blame you, but I just want to ask one thing...\n'If, right now, you were back then, would you still do the same thing?'\n'I would.\n'I'm here now so that Lungmen never goes through anything like that again.'",
