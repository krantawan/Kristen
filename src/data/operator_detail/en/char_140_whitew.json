Her weapon, a specially designed eastern-style sword, complements her Arts. She appears to wield her Originium power untrained, through raw talent alone. Even though Lappland's powers decay rapidly when released, her deceptive fighting style and explosive offensive abilities have allowed her to master her weaknesses. \nFurthermore, Lappland's uncanny ability to discern weakness neutralizes virtually any advantage an opponent with Originium power or other special ability may have.

The weapon granted the king an aura of gravitas that permeated the land, and the king never had to wield it against any enemy throughout his entire life.\nHe once wished to demonstrate his loyalty to Signora Sicilia like the others, yet was rejected nonchalantly. It was then he came to understand how she ruled this country replete with violence, as well as the weariness and helplessness she hid.\nBut now, he had no idea what sort of fangs this strange young wolf should bear.\nAn exquisite rapier, because she would inherit her father's eccentricity and elusiveness?\nA deadly great-axe, because she could not ignore the call of the wild in her blood?\nNo, neither would suffice. The smith tossed the half-finished weapon into the furnace's flames.\nShe was cruel, elegant and elusive as her father, yet something altogether different.\n'It's still not ready? My dear father did say to wait until my coming-of-age ceremony, but our enemies wish to see it tonight.'\nThe swordsmith explained that he was trying to forge a blade worthy of her. But the more he racked his brain, the harder it became to imagine what such a weapon would actually look like.\n'How about these?'\nShe haphazardly picked up a pair of swords.\nOnce upon a time, he had hoped to create a weapon that would serve as a testament to his skill. This pair of swords had demanded too much of his ingenuity, becoming more and more complex in the process. They sufficed as a conduit for Arts, but had become terribly unwieldy in the process, unable to even be sheathed.\n'A failure, destined to never be completed?' The white wolf waved the blades around and bared a smile—'I think I like the sound of that.'\nThe smith pleaded that her unique soul deserved a weapon far more special.\n'I'm afraid you have the wrong idea, sir. What I came here for was a tool. These are sturdy, and more than suitable to kill with. I like the craftsmanship, and plan to keep using them. That's good enough for me.'\nThe despairing smith could do nothing but watch her leave.\nPerhaps, his finest work was something he had rejected as a failure.\nPerhaps, any soul that could be defined by a weapon was too empty to begin with.\nThat night, the renowned swordsmith announced his retirement, and Lappland of Famiglia Saluzzo wielded her iconic blades for the first time—\nFrom that day on, the people would call them 'The Young Fang.'"
