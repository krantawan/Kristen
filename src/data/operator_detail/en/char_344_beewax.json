In fact, she was rather candid throughout the entire meeting, and this straightforward demeanor was consistent with the experiences she had described. In front of us was a young woman who had stepped away from home for the first time, without a deceptive bone in her body or a reason to be wary of others. \nAccording to her statement, Miss Beeswax contacted Rhodes Island in order to find a blood relative who had left the tribe first on a journey. After verification, we found that her relative indeed is an active operator, and belongs to one of our affiliated departments. However, that individual is currently on a secret mission and cannot return to the landship any time soon. \nUpon hearing this, Beeswax was visibly dejected. This young Caprinae from the golden sands does not usually display many expressions, but when her shoulders and eyelids droop, one can see subtle hints of the sense of loss she undoubtedly feels. Fortunately, these depressive bouts rarely last long, and she quickly regains her vitality. \nAt this time, Miss Beeswax made the first important decision since leaving her home to embark on this journey. \nShe decided to become a part of Rhodes Island.",

Akin to the booming and developing beauty industry here, horn care services arose to meet the demand and are well-received. However, even among the operators who are more concerned about their image, very few will make a conscious effort to focus on their appearance. Operators, like Beeswax, who pay close attention their appearance to the point of mastering skills relevant to those interests are among the minority. \nEvery day, Beeswax sets aside a bit of time to maintain her large, curved horns. This maintenance process usually involves multiple steps such as wiping them down with a fine cloth, applying essential oils, soft brush care, and polish. Beeswax always completes each step meticulously, ensuring that nothing is omitted. Through her persistent effort, her horns have achieved a remarkable state of lustre, shape, and hardness. \nThrough our inquiries with other Caprinae operators, we have established that even by Caprinae standards, Beeswax's horns are magnificent, a rare and beautiful sight to behold. \nAfter finishing her daily care, Beeswax often provides help to operators who need it, making her very popular within certain small circles.",

In Beeswax's tribe, it is not unusual for young members of the tribe to go on journeys to the outside world and bring back what they see. Because these journeys have become traditions in their own rights, this particular tribe is unlike many others in that it does not totally reject novel things from the outside. \nIn addition to these journeys, one or two veteran Messengers may visit each year at certain times to bring the latest news to clan members, including the most recent music magazines. \nBeeswax does not appear to be someone who is incredibly shrewd; rather, she is straightforward and easy to understand. She loves music as well. When she left home, she brought with her a number of magazines issued by the Music Society, and these new publications became quite popular among the Caster teams. Even Beeswax herself quick integrated, smoothly establishing good relationships with the other operators. \nThough Beeswax doesn't talk much, is quiet most of the time, and tends to lose her train of thought, by no means is she simple-minded. In choosing to officially become an Operator of Rhodes Island, Beeswax did not rush to her decision, but had to weigh a variety of considerations. \nThe fact that she chose to stay to wait for her relative, while certainly her primary reason, is only one of several considerations. After a bit of inquiry, we determined that Beeswax believes that her time at Rhodes Island will serve as valuable experience to help her pass her tribe's rites of passage to adulthood— or rather, she sees working with Rhodes Island as one rung of that trial. \nAfter comprehensive deliberation, we also saw no reason to deny the participation of a talented and powerful Caster. On one hand, the addition of Beeswax is beneficial to us. On the other hand, we believe that such an option will help Beeswax as well, and Rhodes Island will be able to provide her with many further opportunities to understand this land. \n\nAs an addendum, the young Caprinae waited for several months before picking out her official code name. After writing to her hometown for help, she finally decided on the name she now uses.",

From her descriptions, she tends to use more abstract expressions, trying to depict a conceptual existence rather than a physical object of worship with an actual image.

      "desc": "When a Rhodes Island squad rescued the slender Elafia girl of about eleven or twelve from slave traffickers, she did not cry nor make any noise. Nor respond to any questions pointed at her. A considerable headache for the squad's strait-laced captain, who promptly placed the child in Beeswax's care and left to pursue the fleeing slavers.\nThe captain in all his extroversion likely felt awkward about it, but Beeswax did not. Once she realized the child had no intention of speaking, she turned her attention instead to the jungle, fresh and verdant.\nAfter stepping away for a while, she happened to notice the girl staring at her horns. The two made eye contact, the girl immediately averted her gaze. They repeated this a few times, and then Beeswax moved to speak:\n'You can touch them, if you're curious.'\nThe girl's eyes opened wide.\n'I'm not lying.'\nShe hesitantly stood up, approached Beeswax, and cautiously, nervously reached her arm out, as if a timid fowl was on her hand. She gave the lightest touch.\n'So pretty...'\nSomething Beeswax had heard from many a horned or antlered operator before. It embarrassed and flustered her at first, but she learned in time to reply with a 'yours are wonderful, too,' as was polite.\nBe that so, the sight of the Elafia rescued only moments ago from slavers—soiled, undernourished, even missing a chunk from her antlers—drove a new response to her mind.\n'I can make yours just as pretty. Okay?'\nMarch's spring breeze still carried a chill. The young Elafia sat on the ground. Beeswax cleared the tangle of dirty cotton from her antlers, then took out a care kit. A gauze to wipe the stains away, then a soft brush to clean the dust out from the crevices where the bone forked.\nThe Elafia lowered her head, screwing her eyes shut, as if she were taking part in a solemn ceremony of sorts.\nOnce the cleaning was over, Beeswax took a sanding block and a small file and worked patiently at the dried-out keratin of the Elafia's antlers, before applying a layer of essential oils with due care. All done, she brought out a miniature length of ribbon from her kit, and tied a small bow upon the antler's break.\n'There we are.'\nBeeswax passed the girl a pocket mirror.\nThe girl shied from looking at first, but eventually, she stole a glance, before finally fixing her gaze on it, eyes wide open. A blush bloomed across her sapped face, beyond herself with excitement.\nBeeswax stood up and gave a stretch, before hurriedly remembering the last step had been left undone.\nShe gave her head a light rapping, and drew from her pocket a tiny, golden stone, wrapped tightly in thread. She tied it to the antler left unbroken, working the cord as she recited softly to the Elafia:\n'May the gods bless you. May you be blessed to live in neither bondage nor hunger. May you be blessed to live as do the burning sun, the storms, and the golden plains of sand, in eternal beauty and strength.'",
