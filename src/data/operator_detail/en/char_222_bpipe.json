At first glance, her appearance seems to be at odds with the stereotypical imagery of a serious soldier. At least in her personal life, she does not show much of her military side.\nShe previously attended the Victorian Royal Guard Academy with Superintendent Ch'en. According to her account, the two of them developed a deep friendship during their time as students there. While Ch'en did let out a sigh upon hearing Bagpipe's name, the fact that the former would be willing to vouch for the latter suggests that their relationship can't really be all that bad.",

            "storyText": "Of course, despite the fact that Miss Bagpipe gives off the impression of a cheery 'girl next door,' the fact remains that she indeed was an official soldier in the Victorian army - and an excellent one at that.\nThe Victorian Royal Guard Academy is multi-directional in its educational framework. Unlike other systems of military training, this academy has its own educational policy: of the three directions, most graduates serve as guards for the royal family, nobles, or various dignitaries. Officers generally serve as senior-level commanders in the army, while sergeants generally serve as the army's field commanders and first responders. As a graduating sergeant, Miss Bagpipe undoubtedly possess exceptional military talent.\nIn fact, there are significant fundamental differences when comparing the training of Operators and soldiers.\nOperator training places more emphasis on individual and squad operations, cultivating along the lines of their aptitudes in order to maximize their strength. As reflected by Rhodes Island's collection of highly individualized personalities, Operators must capitalize on their uniqueness, cooperating to complete various objectives with the fewest number of elite Operators.\nOn the other hand, military training emphasizes the collective. The development of a corps is comprehensive, stressing the importance of standardization and interchangeability. The military tends to make decisions based upon overall functionality rather than upon individuals in order to ensure the stability and efficiency of the team.\nDue to this need for comprehensive training, a soldier's combat capabilities must be higher than that of an average qualified Operator. Nevertheless, these two roles scarcely warrant a comparison, because an Operator's job should not be applicable to war - this is something that is to be avoided as much as possible.\nAs a result, Miss Bagpipe is unable to directly become a role model for the other Operators when it comes to developing combat abilities. This was evident early on when Dobermann, Liskar, and Nearl, all professional soldiers, joined Rhodes Island. Though they quickly adapted to their new environment, their military training posed many striking contradictions with Rhodes Island's combat principles.\nHowever, Bagpipe, who passed the military training examination with perfect marks and served in the front lines on the battlefield, still is a prime example of what a good soldier in active service looks like. This should be a healthy wake-up call for certain Operators who think they can match the caliber of professional soldiers, or simply have no idea how the military works.\nThough the projectile function has been removed from her piledriver spear, the weapon itself is still a terrifying ordnance of war. Do not let your curiosity get the better of you - or your life.\nAdditionally, it is worth mentioning that whether due to her natural open-mindedness or due to Victoria's exceptional educational system worthy of its name, Miss Bagpipe did not require retraining when transitioning from a soldier to an Operator, adapting quickly to the new position.\nAs an Operator, she demonstrated the resilience and discipline of a soldier; as a soldier, she exhibited the flexibility and fluidity of an Operator. This has led to Dobermann commenting in private: 'Victoria's superiority over other countries... starts from the professionalism of their military.'",

            "storyText": "Even after graduating from the Victorian Royal Guard Academy and being baptized into modern life, Miss Bagpipe, who was born in one of Victoria's nomadic villages, has retained her countryside flair.\nThis seems to be a product of her experiences growing up in a rural setting, as well as a result of the way she was brought up by her mother. As everyone knows, Vouivre women tend to be very strong.\nSince she was a child, she helped her family with farming and animal husbandry. After joining Rhodes Island, she brought those valuable experiences over to the logistics personnel in charge of related matters. Her enthusiasm in these subjects even made some think that she was transferred to the logistics department.\nFurthermore, she is familiar with large-scale agricultural equipment. Unfortunately, due to space constraints, Rhodes Island's agricultural projects only allow for the use of small tractors, much to her dismay. After all, we can't simply hand over the entire ship to her. \nOf course, none of this means that Miss Bagpipe has no knowledge of modern life - she tried it, but failed. This is somewhat evident from her relatively frequent maintenance applications compared to the other Operators.\nAlso, according to her, she tried to learn how to apply makeup from her upper-crust classmates as a student, but the results were hopelessly embarrassing. She gradually gave up on developing herself in these areas, but she of course is still self-conscious about her appearance... Though she is impeccably dressed as a soldier, she seems to be rather anxious about her casual dress and appearance.\nBut those concerns are hardly warranted. After all, several Operators find her to be cute enough as she is.",

            "storyText": "This was mentioned above briefly, but in fact, if Bagpipe so desired, she could well obtain an enviable status in Victoria's Second Army. Victoria, as the most prosperous empire in Terra, is inseparable from its vast military might. As a sergeant, Bagpipe can also enjoy better treatment than regular foot soldiers, and that's not even factoring in her personal abilities... If she wished to pave a path from her role as an excellent officer to becoming a noble in the big city, there would be nothing in her way\nHowever, she rejected that path. Bagpipe chose to leave the army and her comrades-in-arms, even leaving Victoria behind to roam the dangerous land.\nHer decision to leave civilization and step out into the wilderness is a choice that ordinary city-state dwellers cannot comprehend. After all, leaving the security of civilization is practically a death wish. Bagpipe endured her arduous journey, traveling with Messengers, cooperating with mercenaries, catching whatever rides she could and accepting what little hospitality was available. Due to her identity and nationality, she was forcefully kicked out of some cities, drew the hatred of many, and even got pulled into dangerous conspiracies. According to her, 'I've seen it all.'\n\nNow, she has arrived at Rhodes Island. The friendly Rhodes Island Operators were willing to join her in her struggles, extending a hand of assistance to this seasoned soldier. However, that was the moment her steps faltered.\nThe more she comes to understand Rhodes Island, the more confused she becomes. After going through a series of tests and information exchanges, she became agitated and unhappy upon learning of Reed's presence.\nWhat is it that is weighing down upon her mind? What kind of problem exists that could not be solved by Victoria's military? What happened in Victoria, and what did she and her regiment encounter?\n\n'I used to be a soldier of Victoria. This doesn't seem... to be a responsibility of Rhodes Island. Although I'm no longer in the army, I'm sorry. I... I still am responsible for this. This is part of our duty, and also why we left.'\nMaybe it's not the right time yet.\nMorever, even though everyone looks up to her as a model soldier, the Bagpipe who toils hard in the fields, the Bagpipe who carries three saucepans over to the table, the Bagpipe who sings and spins while wearing a long skirt, the Bagpipe who regales us with dazzling tales of her hometown...\nEveryone loves that side of her too.",

Instead, she, as an Operator, decided to try to open up, albeit slowly and carefully. \nShe might be scared, but she can't run away forever.\nAt least, if one was to consider 'Rhodes Island's Most Likeable Ranking,' she and Grani unsurprisingly topped the list.

      "desc": "Every graduate of the Victorian Royal Guard Academy must go through one final, major examination before their formal ceremony.\nAnd these were the exam details Bagpipe received: infiltrate a logistics warehouse in south Castshire County, and rescue a civilian abducted by local bandits.\nBefore departing, Bagpipe was called to the staff office.\n'Do not alarm the local barracks or the police.'\n'Do not bring unrelated affairs in this.'\n'Do not sustain injury.'\nThese were the three requirements her teacher relayed to her.\n'Are these orders, Mr. Slim?'\n'Ugh,' he sighed, looking her up and down. 'Take this as a request from me to you.'\nEarnest, Bagpipe jotted these three requests down in her pocket notebook, and at the top, she gave the 'rescue!' she'd already written before a mighty underline.\nThe first half of the mission went without a hitch.\nShe infiltrated the target location, laid under a container, waited a full ten hours, and finally the bandits showed.\n'How about her?'\n'Shut her by herself in the red car. How do we handle her?'\n'How? How do we handle her? YOU do me a clean bloody job is how.'\nThe red car. Bagpipe's ears immediately caught the key words, and she locked onto the target without any wasted time.\nLights out for the two bandits posted in the car, and she found the civilian, anaesthetized and unconscious, as well as catching another group's conversation.\n'They all staying put?'\n'Drugged them good. Not going nowhere.'\n'IDs in order?'\n'Baron helped sweeten the police. They move fast.'\n'Any other locals noticed?'\n'Noticed? They just came from Sargon, plus they're all criminal. You think their families'll want to come looking for them?'\n'Alright, then we're off tonight. Got a dozen labs in Columbia poking us in the arse to get this done.'\nTwo seconds Bagpipe hesitated, then she opened her notebook to look. Three seconds her eyes lingered on the first line, and then she shut it.\nThe sound of a freight lorry's ignition reaching her ears, she glanced left and right, then found the largest parked vehicle around, and with the mission objective on her back, hopped into the driver's cab.\nEngine on, accelerator down, nice and easy.\nThe freight lorry didn't get very far at all, before running straight into a container crane that showed up at the entrance out of nowhere. Driven like it was possessed, it smashed half the warehouse wall while it was at it.\nA few minutes later, the alarmed police scurried over, and led away twelve bandits all seeing stars, as well as Bagpipe, who'd lost a bit of skin off her left index finger.\nOnce back at school, Bagpipe sought out the teacher.\n'I'm sorry about those three requests. I couldn't even manage one of them.'\nFor a long while, the teacher was silent, before picking up a recommendation letter to hand her.\n'Ehhh? Storm Company? Could I really, Mr. Slim?'\n'I had the letter ready long ago.'\n'Oh, thank you, sir!'\n'That said... do you know who the person you got into a car crash was?'\n'The mission target, right? No?'\n'A soldier from the Storm Company acting as an unconscious civilian. She and her squadmates were tasked with taking out those twelve bandits in the first place. By the way, thanks to you, their mission's already done.'\n'So where was my target, then?'\n'In the car accident. Don't worry, none of them came to harm, and they're all home safe and sound now.'\n'Then, umm, then... I completed my mission after all?'\n'You did.' The teacher patted her on the shoulder, let out another sigh, and spoke. 'You pass. After you officially report in for duty, you'll be allowed real Fortcracker shells.'\nBagpipe's eyes went wide. Realizing her teacher meant she could be like all the other students, cheering and celebrating their own happy graduation, she pumped her fists, the excitement growing vast in her face.\n'I was thinkin', odd that 'civilian' was over two meters! And she was just too cool! Can-can-can I really be squadmates with soldiers just like her? I... oh, do I need to think of a codename too? What did you say they all use? Instruments? I... hold on, I don't even need to switch codenames then! Sir, sir, is there anythin' you think I should probably bring when I report in? I dunno, d'you think they might not like mince puddin'? Oh, and, and...'\nDon't fault me for this, Rita, trust me.\nYour teacher can't help knowing she's a true good student, and she'll be... she'll be a fine soldier too, for sure.",

      "desc": "'What's all that?'\nThe pawn shop owner fretfully pats a child in the midst of a coughing fit in his arms, not giving a glance to the visitor laying out wares on his counter.\nFor just a wee instant, Bagpipe's shocked to find she can't give the answer to his question. Right, she's more familiar with these two things than anyone. What were they again?\nRight, a stick and a sack.\nIn a hay pile in County Kevin, the stench of almost-fermenting Originium slug mucus bore its way into her dreams. There came an uninvited, extremely peckish old manglerbeast, dripping saliva over her face. Subconsciously, she took that iron stick and gave its head a fierce drubbing, and that was how she lived to tell the tale.\nOn a gravel road in County Peninsula, a checkpoint soldier dragged her out of the merchant's crate she hid in with such grip strength that her arm might've come off. Quickly and resourcefully, she stuffed her documents between the layers of the sack, and bluffed her way past by pretending she was a vagrant bard setting off into the wilds.\nOr, well, was it a crowbar and bugle?\nIn a mire in Connor County, a mercenary's Arts almost shaved the tree above her flat, and her fortcracker's ammo case chose to be difficult at the exact worst time. If it wasn't for her crowbar being just sturdy enough to lever the case's handle, she'd probably be gone on the spot.\nOn the white sands of Castshire County, a soldier gave her life before she could give any last words, the wounded commandant couldn't sound the bugle, and so the unmarked grave lay deathly silent under the beating sun. At least the instrument she had on hand was able to sound clear enough a tone, such that they could send their deceased comrade off with some kind of a decent farewell.\nRight. These were a crank and a set of bagpipes.\nIt was the biggest tractor of the whole village, and the crank it came with was long as half her arm. The arm she dislocated trying to show off that she could do a quicker job than her mum at starting the engine. Sitting on the tractor on the way to the hospital, though, her laugh ended up luring half the village's burdenbeasts after her.\nAnd the pipes made of young cystybeast hide, downy tartan sewn to it by her mum. The village all knew her unique knack for spinning around while she played them. And of course, none forgot how earsplitting those wistful tones were as they echoed all through the village, back when she'd just learned them as a bairn.\nShame that now, after prying a case and doing in a mangler, the crank's bent out of shape, and won't be starting a tractor no more. A dirge played and papers concealed, the pipes are leaking, and won't be playing a tune no more either.\nThe shopkeep squints, peers, then fishes out two grubby coins from under the counter. All up until now, these were what she had left of home. But at the least, with these two coins, home can send her on her way just this once more.",
