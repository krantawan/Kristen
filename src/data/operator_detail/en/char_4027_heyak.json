We have many contacts with close ties to government bodies from multiple countries, and some even visit the landship from time to time. She even used to be one of the Maylander Foundation's top agents, too, manipulating Columbia's gigantic shadow from within...\nEven though she has technically left the organization and we've somewhat restricted her access, her background alone lets her know of their existence, and she may have already obtained some intel. This is evident from her rather contemplative expression as she flips through a list of our operators.\nFurthermore, she usually applies to operate solo on most of her missions. Perhaps this is a habit from her secret agent days, but it is quite worrisome that she does not seem willing to mingle with the others, or even to adjust to life on Rhodes Island.\nOf course, this could also be how she expresses her goodwill. She understands what sort of apprehensions her identity brings us, and has decided to flaunt it rather than downplay it, letting us decide how to treat her.\nTo be honest, she has already demonstrated her expertise in espionage despite having only joined us recently. Our intel work will definitely increase in efficiency and quality if we are to trust her. In fact, she has already shared with us a little on how the Maylander Foundation operates, which has definitely helped us somewhat, but has also left us even more confused.\nOperators over at HR have formed some divisive opinions on her, and it seems like this will remain the trend for some time.\n——Weekly report by HR operator D.E\n\nKal'tsit and I have both put much thought into the matter. Her position is much more complicated than you can imagine, but she will do fine in terms of work.\nAs for her relationship with Rhodes Island... we'll leave that to the Doctor.\n-——A note by ■■■",

            "storyText": "Oh? I had been wondering how to handle my interviewer while in the locker room earlier, but I didn't expect that it would be you, Doctor.\nSo it worries you to have someone else interview me?\nAre you worried about them, or about me? Hmm?\n...Hehe, forget it. Our current relationship should be enough to let us skip the more trivial questions, no?\nHm? You're asking why someone as smart as me would be seeking information on the mythical K'uk'ulkan?\nDid you also try this line on our cute Elf, Doctor?\nHehe... In terms of social status in today's society, surely the resources and position I held at the Maylander Foundation were far more powerful than the 'K'uk'ulkans' who exist today only in name, yes?\nLet's say we disregard authority and just focus on raw strength instead. Could a 'K'uk'ulkan' in its prime handle a few Columbian army divisions? How many seconds could we last against a laser from S.H.A.F.T.?\nMe, my parents, and each and every one of my ancestors residing in my memories. How can we pretend that the very same civilization we have all lived in doesn't exist?\nThe fact that I can talk about this subject is proof enough that there is no actual 'curse' forcing me to act this way.\nIn other words, I could abandon this whenever I want, and so could my ancestors.\nThen why, why oh why, did we not do so? Why did we continue the chase?\n——That would be a perfectly normal response, from a bystander's point of view.\nBut for me? I have had this obsession lingering in my mind ever since I was born. My first word was neither Mama nor Papa, but 'K'uk'ulkan.'\nSo naturally, all of my childhood education was ultimately directed towards pursuing the 'K'uk'ulkan.'\nThis mission is always on my mind, and the most I can do is ignore it for a short while.\nDo you accept it, or ignore it?\nAnd if you do choose to accept... Can you understand how it feels to spend your oh-so-short life chasing after something, only to end up with nothing, Doctor?\nWould you be willing to let it all be forgotten? Or would you pass on your mission to the next generation, and have them inherit your pain, your anger, your pursuit?\nHonestly, it's more like a curse that we've put upon ourselves.\n...Well, it seems like you managed to wrap your head around my words. Well, aren't you clever?\nYes, even then we should be able to ignore our mission, if we really didn't want to continue the chase.\nIndeed, the main reason why 'become a K'uk'ulkan' has remained a desire until now is because of my choice to do so. Our choice.\nHistory, to us, is a mandatory class. We have always been looking for our answer within it, and when we see through the dense fog and realize that we have been performing to no one on an imaginary stage, that modern history is surrounded by towering walls, we lose all interest in the present.\nThe more glorious a civilization becomes as it advances with its technology, the more enthralling our legends become to us. To soar in the skies in our majestic forms with the wind and thunder.\nTo us, the word 'K'uk'ulkan' means both the force of our might, and the truth of our history.\nCall it superstition, habit, or just plain ignorance. I'll allow you the thought, Doctor, because I sometimes think the same.\nAs we continue our pursuit of 'K'uk'ulkan,' we also look for an alternative to free ourselves from our fate, but we always end up where we began.\nUntil Kristen said those words to me.\nLet's call it a day here, Doctor. The rest... is a secret that you'll have to work hard for.\n——Recording of a conversation between the Doctor and Ho'olheyak (1)",

They could soar in the skies and harness the power of wind and thunder, and to this day still exist in the myths of some Sargonian tribes.\nAnd as someone who bears such a myth on her back, her current physical condition and Originium Arts assimilation are simply stronger than most, but that's about it.\nFor someone like me who grew up in an environment full of lineages and glory and all that jazz, I can't say I don't understand her at all.\nBut those kinds of Arts are simply too much for me.\nManipulating such delicate things as memory, emotion, perception, and whatnot is no easy feat. As far as I know, only some of the oldest Sarkaz Royal Court records mention similar Arts, and they're all difficult to work with and come with some kind of absurd price to pay.\nThe Arts of the K'uk'ulkan are completely unrelated to those of the Sarkaz Royal Court, but rather a twisted product of some clue they found somewhere in the annals of their history.\nIn fact, their Elder lifespans are still longer than most people, even halved. But their lives will be forever incomplete. Did Ho'olheyak have a childhood? Will she be able to enjoy retirement?\nIn conclusion, it's neither a curse nor the damage to her physical body that cut half her lifespan away, but the structure of her brain has been permanently altered.\nImagine this: you're a newborn baby with a still-developing body, and someone takes the opportunity to pour a load of information into your brain so it can be passed down to the next generation, unforgotten.\nTo put it bluntly, it's less about the Arts themselves than the extremely inhumane brain surgery carried out with said Arts.\nThe one who invented this procedure was undoubtedly talented.\nEthics aside, one can probably only cast that kind of thing on an infant. There's no way to simulate it to test my theory, but I think once an infant becomes self-aware, this crude method of importing information might not only shatter their mind, but also their very being.\nSuch a procedure is practically unheard of, based on what I know of modern science and Originium technology.\nAnd according to Ho'olheyak, her inherited history began more than four centuries ago. So achieving such a fantastical feat was something you could only dream of in an era when medical science wasn't a thing yet.\nYou'd also have to be a damned lunatic to even try it though.\nThe chances of a procedure like that succeeding aren't very high, and I dare not even ask how many other siblings she had. Even if there were other successes, the damage done to the infant's brain is irreversible. That's the main cause of their shortened lifespan, when as Elders should rightfully be living longer than ordinary races.\nTheir so-called 'legacy,' 'past glory,' and 'absolute power,' have turned their Arts into a curse on their own bloodline.\n——Warfarin",

If you have, I won't mind wrapping my tail around your neck to jog your memory.\nOh, yes. We stopped at 'Until Kristen.'\nWe believe the past holds the truth, and that truth would reveal our true future. She scoffed at our belief, stubbornly asserting that the past is worthless, but the present will lead to the future.\nShe pulled me into her plan, and as it was nearing completion she brought it up so casually... A life pod, I believe was its name? Anyway, she basically gave me all the data from the sarcophagi and told me, now, you can choose to lie in this sarcophagus and turn back into a 'K'uk'ulkan.' But she also asked me:\n'Will it really be worth it, to sacrifice all of your people's lives just to return to the past?'\nThis question has come up in our history too many times to count, but it has never caused a sense of... self-doubt as it did then.\nAnd Kristen... she only came to this conclusion after learning everything. So I had to acknowledge it.\nI'm sure you know the rest, Doctor.\nI escaped from the Tin Man and rushed into that underground space, witnessed the fall of 'God,' and brought whatever remained to you people.\nI obtained nothing from that death that had nothing to do with me. Questions, answers, the past, the future, nothing at all.\nDoctor, I've been on Rhodes Island for a while now, and I now believe that you and Kal'tsit know just as much as Kristen does.\nWhat did you see down there underground? What did you hear, feel?\n...Don't get the wrong idea now. I didn't look for you and Rhodes Island to find an answer.\nThe answers from the past became meaningless when I stopped pursuing the 'K'uk'ulkan.' Kristen cruelly opened the doors of truth, leaving everyone behind, and my sole stroke of luck was to find the two of you standing in front of it.\nRight now I find myself inexplicably smug, but on a lone boat in the middle of a vast ocean. And you, as the only lighthouse that can guide my way.\nSo now, I'll give you a piece of good news and bad news.\nThe good news is that my lifespan will have me dying before you do.\nAs for the bad news, your existence will be passed down through my bloodline, and you won't be able to escape.\n——Recording of a conversation between the Doctor and Ho'olheyak (2)",

So much so that a corner of the room has practically turned into her exclusive spot.\nTry sneaking in there in the middle of the night sometimes.

She also had to hand it over to the Engineering Department for routine checks.\nFirst came the exoskeleton on her back.\nThe dull thud it made upon touching the ground attested to its weight. It was a prototype developed by Raythean Industries, an exoskeleton weighing a hefty 95 kilograms. She had to employ Originium Arts to make it float; otherwise, she had no hope of donning it.\nThe exoskeleton carried an Arts amplification device and possessed some offensive capabilities in close combat. The boxes on their sides contained various necessities. Though it might seem cumbersome in certain situations, most of the time it provided more assistance than a hindrance. What was even more important was that it was modeled after the 'wings' of the ancestral 'K'uk'ulkan.' Her parents and ancestors all possessed a pair of these 'wings,' made from the sturdiest materials of their time. She couldn't possibly remove hers.\nNext was the outer coat.\nThis coat had been recently refurbished and used a new type of fiber developed by Volvort Kochinski, acquired through Maylander connections. Like the impenetrable skin of the K'uk'ulkan bloodline, the material of this outer coat was resistant to conventional weaponry.\nShe carefully detached the tubes connecting the outer coat and exoskeleton. These tubes circulated different fluids in various situations—nutrient solution, emergency medicine, and so forth. The K'uk'ulkan were powerful and solitary; she also had to be capable of handling most dangers alone.\nLastly, there was the staff.\nThe Arts Unit came from a secret laboratory beneath the Maylander Foundation, customized to complement her Arts. She delicately removed a small box from the top of the staff. She didn't care whether Rhodes Island could steal the Maylander technology contained in the staff, but within this tiny box lay centuries of K'uk'ulkan history.\n'Wings,' 'skin,' 'solitude'—these were their burdens, but also their pride. They believed that when they shed these false adornments, it marked the moment they returned to the most primal state of the K'uk'ulkan.\nAnd now, in an empty room, she stared at the box in her hand for a long time until an HR operator called her name.\nAfter a moment of contemplation, she didn't put the box away; instead, she pressed it into the outer coat and walked out of the room.",

She repeatedly requested his assistance in operations for no special reason, and even came to Engineering Department without permission just to be able to spend time with Friston-3 alone.\nAdditionally, Ho'olheyak has been spotted multiple times trying to reach the deepest levels of the ship recently by other operators.\nComment:\nI'll modify and upgrade Friston-3's facial expressions next, and all his work will be temporarily suspended. Report this Ho'olheyak situation to Kal'tsit. She will handle it accordingly.\n—Closure\n\nOperator Special Affairs Approval Procedure—HHY011\nThe day before, the Maylander Foundation sent us a formal cooperation invitation. Ho'olheyak took the initiative to approach HR and express her desire to become the project liaison, saying, 'Am I not the one person at Rhodes Island most familiar with the Maylander Foundation?' Considering the political background of the Foundation, as well as the impossible-to-ignore veiled threats within the inquiry, appointing a former defector as the liaison may create unnecessary tension. Furthermore, we must also consider Ho'olheyak's motivations. We cannot predict what actions she might undertake while trying to shake off any lingering influences from her former employer.\nComment:\nApproving Ho'olheyak's application. Maylander's interest in Rhodes Island is more or less because of her, so sending her will simplify things for us. Also, since she has been with us for quite some time now, we can afford her a certain level of trust.\n—Kal'tsit\n\nOperator Special Affairs Approval Procedure—HHY020\nRegular targeted medical projects are underway. We've also established a team proficient in genetics, mysticism, and history, and everyone is enthusiastic. If only you'd join as well... The K'uk'ulkan clan performs a congenital surgery on its newborns—an act that, while perverse, is fortunately not completely untraceable. If we're able to eliminate the profound effects of the procedure from Ho'olheyak's body and psyche, the results would be absolutely groundbreaking across every field!\nBesides, time is running out, right? If what she said is true, the procedure will likely cause her death in her early forties, meaning she has only a few years to live. She might've once been a massive headache for us, but she's one of our operators now, and we can't just sit back and watch her die.\n—Warfarin\nComment:\nGranted.\n—Kal'tsit\n\nOperator Adaptability Assessment: Ho'olheyak\n'Operator Ho'olheyak seems to have well adapted to the daily life on Rhodes Island.'\n'Hey, don't you think that is even more dangerous?!'",
