Though the steady side of their heart may try to take root when they spend long enough in a safe environment, the remaining facets will only cry out even louder, driving them to the brink of madness.\nKazemaru is exactly that sort of person. A placid life will only dull her claws, murder the gleam in her eyes, and choke the ingenuity out of the origami in her hands.\nWearing the same exact uniform each day, handing her card to business partners, sitting in meetings for hours on end, the only excitement Kazemaru ever got was the occasional chance to nose out intel on rival companies. Though she'd entertained the idea that coping with hopeless days like these wouldn't kill her per se, there came a day when the wind blew over a flowerpot on her way home from work, and she completely failed to detect or dodge it in time. Standing in the middle of the street, her head covered in soil and clay chips, she felt she could bear this no longer. After a whole night discussing her objections with the household, she proposed her own idea to the head, and the young lord gladly gave his consent. He relieved her of her contracts, and handed her over to Rhodes Island.\nFree from the firm, Kazemaru has returned to her scene once again: a battlefield brimming with danger.",

Some people's whole families will be shinobi of Higashi's great households, their fealty sworn for generations. She herself undertook training from the age of five, and the merciless and peculiar-sounding exercises helped her to fulfill mission after mission with flying colors. Moreover, her Originium Arts grant her the ability to control an origami substitute indistinguishable from the real person. Whether to confuse the enemy, aid in combat, or make time to catch one's breath when retreating, Kazemaru can control her doppelganger to her complete satisfaction.\nAs for what her future holds, Kazemaru hasn't thought that far ahead.\nAfter all, she originally reckoned she'd be sworn to the head all her life, and that once she could no longer serve as her lord's blade, she might train newcomers, or go far away and leave it all behind. Maybe even work out a thing or two in the fashion field. But never among these was the option of leaving Higashi to be situated in a Victorian government office, taking down meeting notes.\nThe young lord's abrupt reforms made her realize that so much of the future was beyond her planning. All she needs to do is make every step in the present count.",

When she's back, the first thing she does is enter the conference room, where any passing operator will see the lights remain on from early to late.\nBut whenever they think something HAS to have happened to the people in there, that they should take a look just to be safe, they end up putting their ear to the door and hearing a muffled, unbroken discussion coming from within, and these duly worried operators are forced to let go of their resolve to knock. Of course, not a word of the discussion can be clearly made out.\nConversely, Rhodes Island's children eagerly anticipate such days, for the nice Feline who can make paper things run and fly is about to bring them origami toys more novel than ever.\nThe truth is that Kazemaru isn't playing along with these children of her own initiative; her identity and training up till now wouldn't permit her to do so. But by chance, after the children found out her origami could move, they hounded her, pleading her to teach them how.\nThough she was initially flustered by this, she was quick to brandish her mastery, rapidly taking on the role of a close, big-sister-type friend to the children, a dedicated origami expert, sweets-lover, and enthusiast of play. However, while Kazemaru may have been subconsciously disguising her identity at first, you can imagine from the hints her face lets slip now and then that she really is enjoying herself.\nThe children are delighted on the occasions they meet her, but at the same time worry whether this Feline seemingly not much bigger than them—so short, with fingers so soft—might have gotten hurt outside.\nOn more than one occasion, HR operators have seen this and sighed to themselves: 'they all think Kazemaru can't be more than a few years older than them.

She also makes use of her post to obtain each count's list of industrial property addresses with little effort, as well as detailed blueprints for all manner of buildings and thoroughfares, helping enormously advance every mission Rhodes Island has.\nAt the same time, as a Caladon City Council recorder, she has direct, firsthand access to the councilors' viewpoints. The council nobles think nothing of the employee forever taking down notes in the corner, and as they wage their war of interests, her pen rarely ever pauses. But they don't know just what lies in her writing.\nKazemaru's seen her fair share in Victoria; while it's not quite the same as in Higashi, they have their similarities. She didn't originally have too much of an opinion on it—after all, as a shinobi, the first thing she was trained to do was loyally carry out her lord's orders. However, through completing missions for Rhodes Island, she's gotten to know several Infected friends and noble daughters constantly busy helping the Infected. She's gradually started to shift from her former, rigid, shinobi way of thinking. She's begun to change her goals, no longer desiring solely to fulfill assignments, but to regard the land with a new outlook, make sense of Rhodes Island's ideals, and help deal with the problems the Infected come across, along with the other Rhodes Islanders.\nNowadays (though the Doctor has not requested fealty from her as per her shinobi status), Kazemaru considers what she does here to be much more far-reaching than her time as a shinobi, and she's glad she could take this path. She no longer considers herself just an agent of a family, but an agent of impetus, hoping she can do something with Rhodes Island to change the land, and she has long been willing to offer her loyalty to this work.\n'People are scared of the Infected, but they don't know that the corrupt who duck behind the issue, out to achieve nothing but their own goals, are the ones they should fear most.'\nThese are the words she spoke to the operator receiving her, following full handover of her tasks, when she returned aboard one time to report her work.\nShe's all but clear about what it is she needs to do now.",

Family, loyalty, freedom, future, she has no clear awareness of any of it at that age. She just grits her teeth and endures training too ruthless in some measures for a child, and in her wide eyes gleams light—she wants to be what her strongest senpais are, reach the top, offer her loyalty to the lord.\nBut she doesn't know what 'offer her loyalty' means. She just knows it's an honor, it's what her parents and herself want to do, so she has to do it.\n\nA Kazemaru no longer cleaning the mud from her head again seeks out the young lord.\nShe has become the lord's shinobi. Her hair is bound beneath her hat, her nails orderly trimmed, and missions arrive secretly one after another from the bamboo tubes into her hands. Kazemaru pulls out the scroll inside, and silently looks over. The name she has no recognition of written at the top of that scroll is about to silently lose everything he originally possessed, all before a single fowl is startled.\n'Well done.'\nSo the lord often commends her, but while in hiding, she hears a mother in another courtyard scolding her crying child: 'Keep crying, and the people in black will take you away!'\n\nThe young lord looks at his employee whose head is covered in mud.\nShe changes out of the black bodysuit, and will no longer receives scrolls in bamboo tubes. The old lord has passed, and Kazemaru has a new outfit.\nThe meeting room isn't secret, but it's cramped and inaccessible; contracts fly back and forth in the open, but it's all too smooth and steady. As the days wear on, Kazemaru flexes her stiffened spine at her office desk, joints chafing with a 'krrk,' and the last time she heard that noise, it was like a hidden weapon scraped at her bones.\nShe doesn't like sitting, nor becoming one of the 'people in black' which that mother had tried to spook her child with.\nThis isn't what she's meant to do. This isn't what she likes to do. She wants to do actual good work. She doesn't want to neglect her skills like this. She wants a new way out, but she still hasn't found the full resolve to take the step.\n\nThe young lord reaches out, brushes away the grime caking Kazemaru's pale hair, and hands her a contract termination, along with a business card for Rhodes Island.\nOne time when returning from work, an unsteady flowerpot was blown into the air, crumbs of soil and leaf fragments flying out to form a graceful arc, and the planter compacted with soil plummeted down and crashed straight onto Kazemaru's head.\nHead covered in soil and ceramic chips, Kazemaru was struck awake—she needed to leave. She had to leave."
