Per his account, the moment she stepped into the office, she immediately pinched her nose and frowned. At first, he thought our new Rim Billitonian friend must have had concerns with the agreement's terms, but before he could explain, Cement seemed to have made up her mind and said, 'Um... I think there might be something rotten in here. Probably in the third drawer on the left.' There, the HR operator found an almost finished pack of cookies wrapped with a rubber band... Relevant records show that while in narrow, humid mineshafts, Cement was once able to discern abnormalities in the strata from just the smell. Thanks to this, the workers on her team evacuated, repoured the structure's concrete, and alleviated the shaft's hidden hazard in time. For this, she earned everyone's trust.\nOn the night of her arrival, Operator Cement received invitations from a number of departments and clubs, including the Rhodes Island Cafeteria, the Procurement Department, the Convalescent Garden, the Wine-Tasting Society that Tequila is a part of, the environmental sample analysis team that Purestream is a part of, and more. Cement took each request seriously and responded to all of them. According to Podenco, when she visited the Convalescent Garden, she was able to remember and identify the aromas of more than a dozen kinds of flowers within a few short minutes. She also disappointingly noted that although clusters of flowers like the Garden can be found in Rim Billiton's forests and wildernesses, when there is dust in the air, even the flowers appeared as gray and colorless as the large machines that hummed and roared all hours of the day there. At the very end, Cement revealed that she had an interest in perfuming and thanked Lena and Podenco for their invitation in spite of the fact that she could not stay on the Rhodes Island landship for long because of her busy schedule.\nNot long after, Cement returned to Rim Billiton.",

Regarding her skills in construction and maintenance techniques such as boring, tunneling, and laying concrete, a number of our senior operators unanimously provided the same evaluation: 'exceptional.' All year round, Cement toils away in mining and construction sites across Rim Billiton. Although she lacks systematic knowledge of engineering theory, her abundant on-field experience and skills in machine retrofitting allow her to accurately determine the feasibility of blueprints, as well as the particularities of rock formations and the durability of construction materials. In addition, any equipment that she retrofits can be used in more complicated and difficult construction environments with their functionality and accuracy assured.\n'Drills, work shields, wind gauges, high precision tape measures... These tools are how we make a living. This is a tough line of work. We can only put food on the table if we have what it takes, and it's only by getting ourselves up to snuff that we finally gained a foothold in this business.

During negotiations, Cement often repeatedly emphasizes that the rights her workers deserve during construction must be reflected in the contract— Of course, she also likes to reiterate that they must retain the right to go over, adjust, or modify all blueprints; and that their supervisors must not be able to interfere with the construction process using vague excuses; and that all payments and other compensations must be made on time. Although these demands are nothing unusual, such a conscientious, self-assertive attitude is hardly favorable for an entrepreneur...\nHowever, the data we've collected show that Shana's Construction Crew has enjoyed decent business development in Rim Billiton. The reason, as Cement herself explains, is 'technique.' Their technique is what has allowed them to remain competitive. The construction crew has maintained a zero accident record since its formation, its projects have all exceeded acceptable standards upon inspection, and redoes have been extremely few and far between. In just a few short years, Shana's Construction Crew has quickly gone from a hotheaded no-name company to a highly-rated, reputable business contractor.\nCement has revealed to us that Shana's Construction Crew is currently gradually expanding and attempting to branch out to other lines of business. They have started to take on projects other than mining and construction, such as prospecting and exploratory mining for foreign tech companies, exploratory boring in special environments such as icefields, and providing technological support to tunneling groups... While discussing our partnership's direction with Engineering, Cement even indiscreetly suggested to Closure that she would like Rhodes Island to pull some strings for her to head to Columbia for business exchange and further studies.\n'What's Columbia's Great Expansion really like? How are Rim Billiton's workers different from workers elsewhere?\n'No matter where we are and what it is we do, the work that us laborers put in is always meaningful.'",

Her father was a labor contractor who took on secondary construction projects, and as a kid, she followed him to and from the mines. There, she saw the workers gathered around a boiling pot underneath simple awnings, emptying bottles of Originium Slug beer one after another, their faces still covered in dirt. She saw her father skillfully mediate with safety officers over their nitpicky routine inspections at the bar next to the mineshafts. She saw her father screen a movie outside, for the workers who couldn't make it home for the New Year; a gunshot in the movie woke her up, but she went back to sleep after her father gave her a lolly. She saw the disaster caused by the strata structure's failure, and how her father was shortchanged during the compensation negotiations because the engineering crew comprised many Infected; unwilling to see the victims' next of kin fall to hard times, he used his own savings to foot their remunerations... Soon thereafter, the crew was dissolved for financial reasons.\nWhen asked why she didn't learn from her father's mistake and continued in this line of work, Cement did not give an explanation at all. Instead, she asked with confusion, 'Why not?'\n\nOf course, Cement isn't someone who is overly optimistic or stubborn. Once, a sudden rainstorm interrupted a tunneling project. While everyone else engaged in idle chit-chat at the portable shed, she instead calmly expressed her thoughts on the current situation—\nMost of Shana's Construction Crew's staff are young workers who had the technical expertise to begin with, and the remaining members are showing clear improvement under her urging and devoted tutorage. However, looking at the big picture in all of Rim Billiton, a country where the mining platforms' roars can be heard just about anywhere, most of those who work in the mines are lacking in talent. They may never get the chance to operate high-precision machinery and can only work in strenuous physical labor. Many of them may not even know how to read and write. All they can do is keep their heads down and travel to and from the mines day after day, perhaps never to leave again...\n'I admit that it's too optimistic, maybe even naive, to count on our professional abilities keeping us indispensable to the mines' owners and safe from their bullying...\n'There's nothing I can do to change the mineral resources underground or the politics aboveground, but I still have to do something.\n'As long as there's still a tiny shred of possibility for change.'",

After Cement subscribed to the magazine for Shana's Construction Crew, she personally contacted the editorial team to express her willingness to provide regular monetary support.\nAdditional note: Fifteen issues of <i>Iron Impressions</i> have been published since its inaugural issue, and the magazine has switched from a monthly format to a bi-weekly format since. Its latest issue's 'Workmen's Pen' featured a semi-documentary novel titled <i>Carrot Roots Must Be Deep</i> about a miner who mistakes a sand beast that entered the mines for a phantom.

Say, what point does she have giving us all one of these... works recorder thingym'bobs?'\n'You think I'd have a clue? Yours's been on the whole time. See how you lost it in the first place, maybe?'\n'Sure.'\n\n[Display View] Before clocking out, a worker tosses the recorder aside as he changes.\n'Hahah, my arse someone took it. You lost it your own silly self.'\n'Shtum.'\n\n[Display View] Not long after the worker leaves, Shana suddenly appears in the workplace.\n'Wait, that's the boss, nah?'\n\n[Display View] Shana checks over the equipment for wear and tear, tweaking any gummed-up specimens one by one. She stops before a drilling rig, and fishes out a notebook to write in.\n'Y'know, it stumped me how our machines worked like such a charm without our tiny team having any maintenance people. S'pose the boss did all the work.'\n'That's the Brooks' driller. Definitely had a bit of dullness digging up the rock the day before. They just kept on using it, but I guess the boss noticed straight away.'\n'All our drills are her upgrades, after all. Better than anyone else's. She's the master here.'\n\n[Display View] Shana moves onto inspecting the recent construction. At a part that's been finished, she ponders for a moment before bringing out her recorder and beginning to examine.\n'I know what happened there. Gallen was wanting to give his family a call and rushed to finish. I thought something was off myself. Just was too busy with my own work to take a proper look in time.'\n'Shh—listen to what she's saying. 'Concrete is 3cm too thin.' That would've been a hazard lurking. So she susses out the recorders to catch stuff like this.'\n\n[Display View] Shana nonchalantly tears open a packet of mints, one of which accidentally falls onto the ground. She picks it up, blows off the dust, then pops it in her mouth like nothing happened.\n'*sigh* Funny how she's always so breezy. Guess once she's down in the mines... she'd be like any of us.'\n'Only met one other foreman as good as her in all my working life.'\n'You did?'\n'Yeah, middle-aged bloke. Didn't discriminate against us Infected, always brought his daughter to the site to eat with the crew. I would've gladly worked with him until retirement, but then one time a project he was on caught him. A potential safety hazard became an accident. Had to disband the whole construction crew after that.'\n'Shame.'\n'Been over ten years now, but I think I still vaguely remember his name. Was it... Moleman?'\n'...Y'know, our boss's full name is—Shana Moleman.'",
