When has Victoria ever concerned itself with the great nobles' personal interests? This is his stupidity; the other dukes would never run this sort of business in plain sight.\nHe's been embroiled in disputes, assailed back and front. He hasn't even a chance.\nIn time, yes. Gaul has put considerable pressure on Victoria in this; the frontier duke's defeat in this conflict is precisely the machinations of Victoria's strange decision-making. Victoria has sent no assistance to him. Not even a single ship.\nPresumably, they're watching with folding arms, deliberately seeing him to his death. Victoria—does not have just one mind.\nBut no matter what, Victoria will be too busy to concern itself with those cities stopped over in its northwest wastes; this conflict has facilitated the birth of this Columbia.\nAn opportunity? Theresa... hm. Perhaps it is. The founding of a brand new country is always an opportunity.\nBut opportunity often signifies a source of ruin. The next calamity Kazdel faces may very well be brought about by it.\nDon't joke with me. I wouldn't do such things now, I can promise you... wait, you're making fun out of me, aren't you? You know I'm no longer that sort of person. Besides, unlike in the past, annihilating a country now seems hardly a possible thing.\nThings change, and grasping a country is no longer simple—every person has, from the warmth of Originium engines, drawn their own notions. They have found their own persons, and no longer keep to their laissez-faire ways.\nPerhaps it's a good thing? Yes. If they can persevere.\nHardly anyone left could prevent Gaul's realization of hegemony, and Victoria has already lost several cities on end.\nUnless those few empires could, in this interstice, relinquish their past hatred. Impossible. Madmen, lunatics, speculators and slaveowners? Hah. If they truly had such affinity...\n...You have a point too. Whether they truly could find this chance, we can't say.

This couldn't have solely been the result of a current and storm.\nNot even for Iberia.\nThe Iberians don't have the capability to cause a disaster like this, and Ægir... Ægir's silence is a form of arrogance. This couldn't be the Ægir's doing either.\nMy conjecture: The creatures we previously witnessed are not Ægir's experimental products. It's likely they signify the ocean's true present state.\nThe data left behind by the islanders is a complete match to them; our sorrowing inferences have come true.\nIberia has sunk into quiet, as if the whole of the south has thus faded away.\nIf we wish to learn the concrete state of things, we can only wait for later signal from the Messengers.

Nowadays, a means can become a goal too.\nOripathy, as well as the terrifying prejudice it brings about, require treatment.\nThis will be our new concern. Not only because all present suffer Oripathy's torment, but also because an ideology, one that drives away prejudice... is a thing that needs soil.\nTerminal?\n...No, I don't believe so.

Souls lift her hide-wrought bag, turn her dazedness to weariness.\nShe sees a land without limit, a land rich with life. She feels something tightly grip her hand. She looks back, and in the haze of memory fumbles for her own name.\nKal'tsit.\nShe knows she was born into these ruins of civilization bearing a calling, but there is no one to shine a light on what is to come for her. Ultimately, she cannot live free from this calling. It is akin to taking a meal, or sleeping.\nShe begins to walk, walk upon the lost dust, carefully sorting through her myriad years of memories and knowledge. She sees a new nation rise from yet more ruins. She recalls how the result of her abandonment was deposed royalty. She sees fresh, novel flags howl atop the blood-soaked battlefield. She recalls how both sides of the war united against a common enemy in those ancient times.\nShe sees forests yet thinks of barrens, gazes on mountains yet recollects lakes—she walks through the river that is Time, picking up stones, while the eras surge, parting around her, rushing forward on.\nBut she is immutable. She has no past, and no future either.\nIt takes her a deal of Time before she has her thoughts reorganized. She remembers the last death. The years stretching long enough to see the form of life itself change. Still, she never thought death would be so fast; some things are changing at this very moment.\nLives flourish without rhyme or reason, and the land morphs and fluctuates. Man-made machines operate with a rumble, the radiance of Originium energy shining into the umbra. In the dark, the people struggle, yearning for the light, scorning shadow in an age of brilliance, on and on. Her countenance is concealed by the flurry of grit stirred by a nomadic city, and she feels anxious to the depths of her heart.\nDoes the will that hid the stars behind the false sky still watch the surface recur in its rise and fall? How long until the Terrans, so proud of their thriving civilizations, personally send those same civilizations into the ice-cold void, to join countless lost lives?\nTime is running short. This is what Kal'tsit tells herself. She has fallen to blaming herself. She has wasted too much Time, and at so many moments barely averted the self-destruction of Terra, barely led them to a safe place to develop. It has exhausted her, drained her.\nShe is no omniscient, omnipotent being. And yet, she tasks herself with tending to the entire World.\nHer calling was never a fair one.\nShe has to hurry. She has to do whatever it takes.\nHer gaze comes to rest on a shattered Kazdel. It is far from the first time she's touched on the legend of the Lord of Fiends. In the boundless years, more than once she has thought of retrieving and exploiting this ancient force. She cannot help but stifle her memories of the Teekaz—to make an effort not to long for the bygone days where Originium had not yet molded life into its present form, and not to commemorate a possibility that has long since vanished.\nMaybe this time, it's time she made up her mind.\n......\n...\n'So this was your previous journey, Kal'tsit.'\n'It stretches longer than the fragment you've seen. Thousands and thousands of times longer, Theresa.'\n'But perhaps it's only now I've truly understood you... my enemy.'\n'...I feel the same, King of Sarkaz.'",

      "desc": "The wind and sand kissed the sky, and by an oasis pool in the distance, a wandering merchant rested.\nKal'tsit stayed silent for a long time, standing on the deck. Occasionally, she looked out into the distance, and sometimes down at her feet. It was as if the ship called Rhodes Island was hiding something from her. Until a young vampire stepped forward, holding a stack of documents. Hesitating slightly, Closure interrupted Kal'tsit's thoughts.\n'Rhodes Island Pharmaceuticals Inc.' Closure feigned a smile, swallowing her memories, and decided to continue, 'The work on this side of Rim Billiton is already done. Whew, those rabbits are a pain, none of them're as cute as Amiya. They wasted so much of our time, insisting the ship was registered for ore hauling...'\nClosure paused.\nFortunately, Kal'tsit snapped out of her reverie in time and gently responded in an almost soothing tone, 'Thank you for your hard work.'\n'What's next?'\n'Continuing the discussions we didn't finish in the last meeting.'\n'Are we going to lose more people?'\n'More people will leave.' Kal'tsit gazed into the distance where the wandering merchant had packed up, 'They belong to Babel, not Rhodes Island. I just hope there won't be any more bloodshed between us.'\n'I understand, but—'\nA voice interrupted the two.\n'Dr. Kal'tsit? Closure?'\nThe moment she heard the voice, a gentle and caring look flashed in Kal'tsit's eyes, but she quickly composed herself. 'Amiya, you should be resting.'\n'I'm fine. I just had another nightmare.' Amiya tugged at her collar, the wind was strong, and she was small, 'The trip to take the Doctor to Chernobog, and the days we spent in the wilderness... those Sarkaz warriors...'\nKal'tsit and Closure exchanged a quick glance. Closure understood what Kal'tsit meant; after all, both Ascalon and Ace visited Amiya often.\nThey didn't say anything; Amiya could sense it now as well.\n'Yes. They chose to be our enemies.'\n'Why?'\n'Because they live under the beautiful promise of Babel. They don't want to give up that illusion. And to them, we are deserters.'\n'Is Miss Theresa's promise an illusion?'\n'To them, yes.' Kal'tsit stood quietly beside Amiya and reached out to pat her head; she had grown a little taller. 'But they believe that continuing the war will solve all their problems.'\n'They're not entirely wrong, though.'\nKal'tsit was slightly surprised for a moment. She looked at Amiya, gazing at this tired and lost girl for a long time, until she finally felt a sense of relief. 'You're right, Amiya. They're not entirely wrong.'\n'What about the Doctor? Is Ursus safe?' Amiya looked up at Kal'tsit. 'I miss the Doctor a bit.'\nThis innocent gesture made Kal'tsit slightly flustered. At that moment, Closure embraced Amiya from behind.\n'Look, Amiya!'\nAmiya looked and saw an unfamiliar Rim Billitonian merchant, kicking up dust in the distance. The sand-covered cart tied with packages appeared heavy, and somehow cute.\nClosure playfully smiled and held Amiya even tighter.\n'Rhodes Island's journey is just beginning. When the Doctor returns, we'll be Terra's greatest Oripathy experts!'",
