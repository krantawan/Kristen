Through her father, she had access to all the greatest art salons, and was profoundly influenced by the scene from a very young age. Enamored of oil painting, she resolved to become an artist. Under the guidance of her father, Deepcolor quickly showed a tremendous talent for painting and she began her art studies and easily earned the grades to be accepted into Thyssen University, where she attracted the attention of a certain advanced Originium institute in Victoria, leading her to triple-major in Originium control. After graduation, she received an offer from the Harmenszoon Design Studio and worked there for almost three years. \nNote: All of the above was provided by Deepcolor herself. Intelligence gathered from informants and confidential reports have revealed several inconsistencies in her account. It is advised to approach all background information provided by this Operator with skepticism.",

It has been confirmed that Deepcolor has a photographic memory of the appearance and detailed features of every Operator she has ever met. Through simple observation, she derives a complete picture of their bodies and even minute imperfections that the Operators themselves are not aware of. By further analyzing these data, Deepcolor can summarize her subjects' private information that most intelligence operatives would need long periods of observation to acquire, such as lifestyle choices and daily habits. \nAccording to Deepcolor's personal account, this is nothing but a basic skill possessed by all painters, and she is still at the shoal of the sea of art.\nNote 1: The sea she describes and the 'Deep' in her code name are strange concepts for some Operators. Please see it as 'boundless water.'\nNote 2: After rejecting Deepcolor's request to paint a portrait of the creator of this file, the profiler still received a sketch from her.",

Her combat style isn't exactly orthodox--air-painting is not a known Artcasting method, nor is it easy to comprehend. \nFurthermore, perhaps most difficult to understand are the creatures she commands, dubbed 'helpers' (or 'tentacles' by nosy Operators). The reason these long, thin threads are called 'creatures' is because they possess the intelligence and mobility of a pet trained to follow orders, greatly adding to Deepcolor's combat flexibility. After comparisons to the 'Meeboos' created by Mayer of the Rijn Life Research Center, these creatures are actually mechanical entities defying any existing classification. They have spindly bodies without noses, mouths, or ears. \nAccording to Deepcolor's own reports, these creatures were captured by her father somewhere in faraway Sargon as a gift to her. She summed up the 'helpers' as merely 'as yet unclassified creatures.'",

Or is this her Originium Arts?\nI am starting to be scared.\nShe seems to have noticed how disturbed I am.\nShe smiles and starts comforting me, telling me that this is just a part of her Arts.\nAs she says that, a tiny creature appears on her palette.\nShe tells me that this is her 'assistant.'\nThe critter may not seem like it's capable of making any sounds that are less than pleasant, but I seem to be able to hear some strange noises whispered into my ears.\nI do have to admit, though. It looks really cute.\nIt's leaping back and forth between the canvas and the paint every now and then.\nIt seems it's helping Deepcolor finish this painting.\n'So that's your assistant!'\nI can't help myself but to exclaim.\nShe nods.\nShe's smiling.\n......\nHow time flies; the painting has already been completed.\nShe hands the painting to me, and I pay her the commission we'd agreed upon.\n'You'll love this portrait for sure!'\nShe seems really happy.\nOf course, I am happy too. After all, what is there to be unhappy about when a painter hands you a freshly painted portrait, especially one so lifelike?\nThe colors are bright and vivid, and the expression is true and genuine.\nThis is magnificent!\nAs I mount the painting, a question suddenly comes to mind.\nThough it was on my mind just moments earlier, I immediately forgot about it when I laid my eyes on the painting.\n'Has she ever used any colors other than blue?'\n'Where did that discomforting noise come from?'\nWho cares?\nReally, who cares?!\nIt's not nice to pry into somebody else's secrets!\nEven if something might seem off, what does that have anything to do with me?",
