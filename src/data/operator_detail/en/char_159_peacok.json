Based upon available historical records, there are few mentions of those called 'Conviction,' but one can clearly conclude that this name does not refer to any specific single person. In history books, descriptions of Conviction's race are not consistent, with the earliest records stating Conviction as from Minos. Despite these discrepancies, these records are all similar without exception in describing Conviction as beautiful in appearance, good at dancing, harboring a strong sense of justice, generally being skilled at a special type of boxing, and proficient with arts.\nUnlike normal boxing techniques, Conviction's special technique weaves in Originium Arts. Often referred to as 'Conviction Punch' in records, this special combat style is characterized by footwork akin to dance steps. According to the depiction on a mural, this is a type of assassination technique designed to strike in an unexpected way. Some of the attacks within this technique, when first launched, may appear to just be dance moves to observers. However, bystanders may also get hurt in the process.\nThe most details about Conviction in the historical record are said to come from a number of chapters from a certain story, and this is considered to be the most reliable known source despite slight discrepancies in the details.\n\nFrom 'The Way of Arts - Apocrypha of Conflict':\nOn the first year of the modern epoch, a group of artists established the ancient kingdom of 'Agamem.'\nAmong the artists of Agamem, a group of them rose to become the ruling class and in a bid to seize all the country's property, announced a national ban on the creation of high-end art and declared the tomato as the country's sole staple food.\nThe artists of the country soon were forced into a miserable existence, trying to sell inferior works of art in order to put tomatoes on the table.\nOne day, an artist stood up to challenge the unjust rule. On the first day of April, the artist convicted the seven rulers with a series of superb punches. As a result, Agamem was able to enjoy a long period of peace, and flourished as a paradise for artists.\n\n'Agamem? Super Artist Wars? Only eating tomatoes? What a load of rubbish. Why not focus on the birth and life of Conviction? Does the person who wrote this book bear some ill will against Conviction's peerless power? If it was up to me, information other than the Conviction and Art won't be included! Quick, find the person who wrote this book! I shall convict them!'",

            "storyText": "[The Train Dilemma]\nA large number of historical documents provide detailed accounts of Conviction's famous 'train dilemma,' a philosophical question which has been greatly discussed for many years. However, there is no indication that anything resembling a 'train' or train-related technology existed in ancient Agamem, but the records clearly state that 'trains' did in fact exist. This sheds some doubt upon the authenticity of the origins of the 'train dilemma.'\nThere is also a variant of the train dilemma involving trolleys, but electric trolleys were invented even later than trains were...\n\n'Conviction's Justice': \nWhen Conviction brought judgment upon Agamem, seven criminals were seized for suppressing the development of art.\nIn order to punish them, Conviction tied six of them on the train tracks of an Durin train.\nThe last was posed an impossible problem, doomed to ponder this question forever while eating nothing but tomatoes.\nTo commemorate the artist who stood up in the face of injustice, the people of Agamem named this person 'Conviction,' and the problem was named the 'train dilemma.'\nAs a caution to future generations, people reminded themselves to exercise their arts and to never be picky eaters, lest they too be posed with the terrifying train dilemma.\n\n'300 Philosophy Study Exercises': \nConviction brought 7 convicted artists to a railroad that split off into a forked junction; five of the convicted artists are tied to one side of the tracks, while one was tied to the other track.\nAt this time, a Durin train is headed towards the junction and is about to run over the side where 5 convicted artists are tied down.\nThe last of the 7 convicted artists is not tied down, and there is a lever next to him. If he pulls the lever, the train will change course, only running over one person.\nConsidering the above situation, if you are the last convicted artist, should you pull the lever? (50 points available)\n\n'What's wrong with eating tomatoes every day? I'd gladly do that anyway. The rest of you aren't down for that? Forget about becoming Conviction, you're not even good enough to be an ordinary artist. Now that's the true crime. Oh, that's right! I know a great way to help you find enlightenment - you just have to lie down on those tracks over there!'\n'The train needs a Durin to operate, right? Wait, are you seriously asking why this matters? That's part of the art. Art, you understand? The kind of person operating the train, the brand of the train, what material the tracks are made of, the rope used to tie these people, and how many people are tied down to each rail - these all factor into the equation. Each of these small details determine whether or not the train rises to the standard of a dilemma - is that how you really see it? Well, don't blame me for what happens next! Take this, the second Conviction!'",

The number of techniques in 'Conviction Punch' corresponds to the number of people who were sentenced by Conviction.\n'Abridged History of Dance':\nAgamem's Way of the Righteous Fist shall be passed down forever.\n\n'Legends of Righteousness - The Conviction Saga':\nIn many folk tales, Conviction did not directly deliver sentences because the convicted party may have been innocent. As a result, Conviction would issue the train dilemma to test the party in question. Conviction would praise those who passed the test on having great talent in the arts, and encourage them to persevere in their pursuit of art until their works entered the annals of classics.\nIt is said that at first, artists that weren't main stream were outcasted; but over time, these artists rose to fame as talented judges of virtue. These are all related to Conviction.\nCertain medical reports exist suggesting that only eating tomatoes for an extended period of time leads to nutritional imbalances.\n\n'Who dares classify my Conviction Punch as a dance? And what is this about nutritional imbalances? Do I look scrawny to you? Hmph! Hmph! I bet you can't even follow my fist! An ordinary Operator's gonna get sent flying if they eat one of these! Wait, why are you trying to change the topic? If you can't answer my dilemma, that's fine, nothing to get ashamed about.'\n'Right, there's nothing to be ashamed about, because I'll convict you on the spot! If once doesn't do the trick, then I'll do it again until I beat the sin right out of you! We'll see what breaks first, your foolishness, or my revolutionary crime-busting skills!\n'Eat this!

It's totally gaudy.'\n'Conviction is an extremely sacred existence, with extremely serious rituals. Naturally, the cooler the better. Don't concern yourself with unimportant things. I've recently discovered that the traditional trolley problem isn't difficult enough to challenge the geeky fellas these days, so I'm working on an upgraded, super-difficult version. I ask of you...' \n'Ahahaha, I suddenly remembered I have something to do. Let's talk more later.' \n'Fortune teller, your divination exists at the intersection of mysticism, logic, and art, just as Conviction's prior trial. I ask of you...' \n'Divination is much more practical than simply confusing people with riddles.' \n'Oh, Singer, I ask of you...' \n'......' \n'An upgraded version of the trolley problem: the surgery problem! Take this doctor next to me as an example. One day, this skilled and compassionate doctor treats six patients. They are dying and each needs different organs to be transplanted soon in order to survive, but the hospital doesn't have any of the organs in stock. While the doctor is performing a routine checkup on another patient, the doctor discovers that the patient's organs would not be rejected by the six dying patients. In fact, they would be a perfect fit. Additionally, this patient is only passing through for a checkup, and even if this patient disappeared, it would not provoke any suspicion. Now then, how should the doctor proceed? \n\nThe trolley problem is not about the answer that the respondent gives in the end, but rather about the conflict between nature and humanity experienced in the formulation of that answer. Whether the respondent hesitates, calculates, finds the situation unbearable, weighs emotions over righteousness or vice versa, all of these struggles are reflected on the outside, through micro-expressions, through one's eyes and very demeanor... \nYou really have no sense of artistry... Conviction, Conviction of course is an art. To stand trial before Conviction is an art. Every aspect of the Conviction Fist is also an art. People who have passed Conviction's test transcend and move to a higher realm. This, too, is art! Ah, whatever, it's impossible to explain these things to you people.'\n'But, you just scared that doctor away!'",
