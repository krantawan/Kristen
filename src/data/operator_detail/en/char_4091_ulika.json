She also serves as a consultant and provides support when Rhodes Island interfaces with media organizations.\nOther than Click, who once lent her a helping hand, Streamer U has also had encounters with a few other Rhodes Island operators, though not always under pleasant circumstances and while going by a different name.

Okay then...\nOur guest today is none other than the hottest of them all, the most passionate operator at Rhodes Island: THRM-EX!\n......\nYou say that your 'thermal shock is undefeatable,' but is that really true?

As long as I don't disrupt the lives or work of any other operators, there are no breaks on this train! If yours truly manages to accomplish this feat, you'd better shower me with donos!

Now, let's have a taste...\n(Violent coughing sounds)\nN-No, I don't need water! I said I'm doing a mukbang, so I have to finish the goal I set for myself!\n......\nI'm fine... Streaming is my job... I need to maintain... a professional attitude... See, there's only one piece of meat left on the platter... It'd be a shame to let it go to waste...\nHave I ever considered doing an event organizer gig in Shangshu? Hehe. C'mon, when have I ever turned down a business offer? But, lemme finish my food first...\n\nFootnote: Due to excessive sweating, Streamer U collapsed from dehydration after eating the last piece of meat and was rushed to Medical. Thankfully, she did not incur any serious injuries.\nAddendum: FEater was moved by Streamer U's professionalism and dedication to her craft, and is currently contacting her acquaintances in the Shangshu art and literature circles to try to expand the streamer's career options.",
