Her academic record at school was considered above average; despite her intense efforts studying, she was never able to rank at the top. She felt a sense of dejection and disappointment, her character growing increasingly introverted alongside.\nWhether in her teachers' or her family's eyes, the earnest, hard-working, clever and amenable Mulberry was a sweetheart who put others at ease. Not too individualistic, not quite outstanding, but meek, untroublesome, didn't overstep her bounds—the picture of a good child.\nMulberry's mother and father long had plans for their daughter's future; they hoped Mulberry would receive a sound and fine education, then find a safe, stable job, and live what, to an ordinary person, would be a calm and fulfilled life. But against everyone's expectations, the obedient-since-birth, rarely self-expressive Mulberry went against the norm. She didn't heed her family's arrangements, but instead, following her graduation, delivered her resume to 'Chun-qian' without telling her family, and went far away from home.\nAs one would imagine, this unprecedented rebelliousness of hers caused a huge commotion in her family. But just as Mulberry had written in her farewell letter to her parents, ever since witnessing the tragedy of a Catastrophe in her youth, she had secretly fostered her own ambitions, and only in this regard was she unwilling to defer to her elders' plans.\nThe girl summoned the greatest courage of her life, and set out to decide her future for herself.",

And it's because of her anxiety that she always has, purportedly very effective, protective charms hung all over her personal belongings. At most times, the impression she gives is introverted, timid, careful and cautious, gentle yet frail. But when involved her field of specialty, Mulberry will temporarily throw off all cowardice and hesitation. At these times, as a relief worker, for the sake of those she's saving, she has to become reliable.\nThe resolve and self-confidence Mulberry displays during her work can surprise any operator working with her for the first time.\n\nMulberry's parents' expectations were for her to have a smooth and steady life, but with her Oripathy infection, such expectations are now wild dreams.\nPerhaps, when leaving home, Mulberry felt discontent with her family's plans, and rebelled against their control. But after joining the relief squad, after wrapping herself in a standard sleeping bag and knowing the sensation of her extremities frozen numb; listening to the gale outside her tent, alone, too scared to even sleep the whole night; at the height of the wind's howls, furtively shrinking out of homesickness into her sleeping bag to weep, letting the sound of the wind cover her own sobs... after going through all that, her varieties of discontent, of complaints and rebellion, all dissipated into unimportance.\nBut happily, in her second year with the squad, Mulberry—gradually accustomed to the arduous work life—restored normal relations bit by bit with her family. One time while on her way to visit home, Mulberry witnessed her father, who had been so vehemently opposed to her joining a relief organization, holding a letter she'd sent, standing at the corner of his street, mentioning her name to the neighbors.\n'This is work that saves people! Our girl's not scared of a hard time. Good on her!'\nThat proud look never shown to her before, spread across her ever-strict father's face, is a sight Mulberry reckons she'll remember forever.",

Those who head in to make the rescue are also enduring one rigorous trial after another.\nNo matter how strictly you prepare gear in advance, things can slip through the cracks. Active year-round in Catastrophe zones, rescuing those affected, there are times workers even face a sudden second disaster. In a profession as hazardous as a relief worker's, Oripathy infection is very hard to avoid.\nThe moment you choose this line of work, you've already chosen to set own your safety aside.\nOf course, this much is true for Mulberry.",

Your second sister has been transferred to work in Danyan, and she went up the mountain there and picked some nerve-soothing herbs for you. She plans to send them to you via a Messenger—has your address changed recently? If it has, please write back soon to let us know your new address. Or maybe she can ask the Chun-qian team to contact Rhodes Island's office and give the herbs to them. Which way works better for you?\nAs for what you asked about in your last letter, your dad has already looked into it for you. Thankfully no one was hurt in the snowstorm last month. Your dad carried the disaster-prevention pamphlets you sent back and handed them out door-to-door. The teachers at the local school read those pamphlets and even praised your writing, saying your wrist strength has greatly improved. When he told me this, I felt really happy for you, but when the night falls, I still can't help but feel a bit sad. Ning-Ning, my girl, you're far from home now. When you sit at the desk writing and studying until your fingers are all sore, you wouldn't be able to run over to me for a good massage... All I can do is remind you to rest well in my letters. You've always been a smart child, and now you've even learned much about saving lives. I'm sure you know better how to take good care of yourself, right?\nOh, I have a funny story to share with you. The festival is coming up next week, and not only are the kids excited about the rice dumplings and snacks, even Grandma is thrilled. When the weather is nice, she likes to do some needlework on her lounge chair, but her eyesight isn't great, so she always needs help threading the needle. One afternoon, when I got back home from work, she complained to me that she had called for you many times in the morning, but you never came. I didn't know how to explain it to her; it was both funny and a bit sad. I took the afternoon off that day and made two sachets with Grandma. Actually, I've never really sewed anything before, so my stitching came out all crooked—you'll probably recognize which one I made at first glance. Or you can tell it by its smell. I filled it with some dried acanthopanax root, the same herb we used to put under your pillow to help calm your mind. Hang the sachet by your bed and it should give off a gentle scent that might help you sleep better.\nYour dad and I agreed to cooperate on this letter and it was supposed to start with me writing and then your dad finishing it. But he sat there chewing on the end of his pen half the night without writing a single word. With the Messenger arriving at dawn, I decided to just finish it myself. Everything at home is going well, and both your dad and I are doing fine at work. Whenever people talk about you, they always praise how strong and brave you are. Your father and I have read your last letter over and over again.\nIf you have the time, maybe send another letter home?",
