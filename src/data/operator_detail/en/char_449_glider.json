She's familiar with the medicinal worth of flora common to Rim Billiton, and has a mastery of other knowledge and skills that come with forest life, such as building treehouses, identifying fruits, climbing trees, as well as... jumping down from high places.\nIt's hard to summarize in one word Operator Honeyberry's ability to 'jump down from up high'—it's difficult to even call it an ability, so much as it's a unique hobby of hers. She's never had physical or technical training, nor has she mastered any special Originium Arts; she simply stands up high where any normal person would be dizzy, recklessly estimates how far she is from the ground, and then extends all four limbs, and soars—\nShe can land safely without anyone catching her, but still, if she can drop into a friend's embrace, that's all the happier.",

So she answered, ardently defending the dried berries she held.\nHoneyberry gave nothing up after getting a taste of Hibiscus's stubbornness, instead she found several journals from Columbia, Victoria and the like, flipping to each noted page number, revealing each relationship between sugar intake and happiness, psychological health and physical health, etc. etc. before Hibiscus.\nThe resolve in her eyes was dazzling, paired with invincible psychosomatic medical theory, leaving even Hibiscus powerless to fight back; she couldn't even stave off a kind invitation from Honeyberry, and gingerly, cautiously, ate a dried berry she'd normally never think of touching.\n\n'Is Honeyberry in? I wanna ask her to dinner, give her my proper thanks. Huh? Of course I'm not inviting her to eat my sis's health food. Even if it's barely more edible thanks to her, having her eat that stuff couldn't count as thanks in a million years.'\n—Lava, on a rare proactive visit to the Medical Department",

She's never had any systematic medical education, nor has she been any folk herbalist doctor's apprentice. In her own words, her knowledge of theory primarily comes from an old edition of the Victorian-published 'Complete Guide to Medicinal Plants.'\nHaving such a deep understanding of herbology based on just a single reference book is of course unimaginable; however, once we saw every page was crammed full of notes in the margins, and especially when we discovered these annotations weren't just decoding and organizing the book's contents, but a vast amount were records, analysis, and even correcting the print on the practical effects of herbals, our astonishment became admiration, and we couldn't help but want to pat this girl on the head and tell her she really was incredible.\nNeither Honeyberry nor her mother is Infected, nor do they have any other severe organic disease in particular; however, Honeyberry's mother has a minor chronic illness, bedridden at times due to a common cold or joint pain—plus living long-term in a forest rich with vegetation, this was what made Honeyberry delve so deeply into herbology.\nHowever, though herbology can alleviate slight ailments, her mother's physical condition has stayed unwell, and is even declining. After a whole month with a cold, Honeyberry finally talked her mother over, used half their household savings, and went to find treatment in a nomadic city.\nLuckily, they met a specialized doctor, and after carefully noting Honeyberry's oral account of the medical history, and completing a multitude of examinations, the doctor gave a precise verdict: what was overcoming Honeyberry's mother wasn't any organic pathology, but a lasting mental pressure. He recommended her mother stay away from any sources of stress, and ideally live somewhere different.\nAs a demand, it was far too excessive for the mother and daughter. Despite that, Honeyberry, now knowing the cause, immediately switched into studying psychology. At the same time, to bear some of her mother's economic pressure, she began delivering her own resume to every firm she could find, with her own self-written herbological thesis enclosed within.\nMany companies were very quick to express interest in her. Summing consideration for work details, settling family, salary and all other various factors, Honeyberry chose Rhodes Island, and after confirming with HR, brought her mother with her.\nBenefitting from better economic circumstances, higher medical standards and Honeyberry's untiring efforts, her mother's health has shown signs of improvement.",

With his attitude of responsibility to the village, and despite his wife and daughter being opposed, he informed the village people of this fact, but was immediately expelled, even his two family members forced into the forest with him.\nAfterwards, knowing his days were numbered, he went to the village to negotiate, hoping at least his uninfected wife and girl could live there again, but was outright refused, the reason being that even if his family weren't now, they might become Infected in the future. In despair, the man came home and informed his wife and child of this, thereafter disappearing into the dark forest, never to return.\nPerhaps we can imagine, supposing her father wasn't Infected, that with Honeyberry's bright mind, she could find work in some post at some mining firm's dispatch program, living a plain but stable life with her family, just like her mother once did.\nBut no matter the case, Honeyberry is here now at Rhodes Island, has proved her ability to the Medical Department, 'occupied' a tiny little conversation room, and occasionally even performs her jumping feats from high up on the deck, gracefully landing in a friend's arms—that friend is often Mint, and at times, the Doctor too.",

'filthy Infected family' and the like—her health got worse, and my dream got a little more practical: I wanted to become the best herbalist doctor in Rim Billiton, and let my mother be healthy.\nOnce I began studying psychology, I finally understood how my mum's illness came about. Even after psychological counseling techniques helped her, I just got more pessimistic.\nIf only my mum wasn't the family of an Infected, we wouldn't have to face all this harassment and discrimination. She wouldn't be flattened by life, and she wouldn't be as frail as she is now. But, you know, how brilliant a counselor do you have to get, before you can sweep the fear and prejudice out of people's minds?\nAfter I came to Rhodes Island, I finally realized, people can't be changed by a couple hours of discussion. But the thing is, so long as you have the courage to take that first step towards somebody Infected, most prejudice can be resolved in time.\nAnd helping people pluck up that courage, take that vital first step, that's my most important duty as a counselor.\n—Oh, Doctor, don't get me wrong, no matter what the reason is, you can always book an appointment at my conversation room. No matter if it's mental pressure or everyday hassles, even if you just want to chat, you can come by! Right, and, I've gotten an approved qualification from the Medical Department, so there's even more I can handle! If you ever need help, Doctor, make sure you tell me!",

She tried to convince her mother that the missions were safe, but her mother was unusually stubborn. Advice turned into argument, and the argument festered like a dull thorn. Standing at the edge of a cliff with shouts behind her, all Zoey Perris could think of was her mother's anxious eyes when she left Rhodes Island.\nAs her pursuers closed in, Zoey leapt off the cliff. An arrow whizzed past her, and she suddenly realized that to her mother, frayed hems meant falls, holes implied an arrow had missed a vital spot, and tears suggested narrowly saved limbs.\nFor the first time, she made her daughter unhappy over a field mission.\nDespite Zoey explaining the safety of these missions many times, she couldn't shake those ominous dreams. She opened the door to find Zoey standing outside, with the tattered cloak covered in dust.\nSuddenly, regret washed over her. She was the patient to be cared for, and it was her daughter who managed everything perfectly. Life wasn't about Zoey easing her burdens anymore, but about her trying to ease Zoey's.\nShe let Zoey take off the cloak, admitting she'd been overthinking. But Zoey didn't respond. Instead, she pulled her mother to sit down and began explaining the damages on the cloak—branches, gravel, finbeasts... until she reached the rip made by an arrow.\nShe saw her mother gently shake her head, more pleading than forbidding. But she continued, recounting how an infected man, almost enslaved because no one would help him, led to the slaver firing that arrow out of spite.\n'Each mission, we actually helped some people, who were just a bit luckier than Dad, who didn't vanish silently. And the damage to the cloak isn't always from weapons. This time, it was just this one arrow... I can take care of myself. Please rest assured.'\nZoey bit her lip, looking at her mother, whose face showed a mix of sorrow and pride. Finally, her mother silently patted her head, took off her cloak, and draped the previously mended one over her shoulders.\nThe sewing machine hummed as Zoey, wrapped in the carefully patched cloak, tiptoed out of her mother's room, silently apologizing for calling a blade a fin.\nBehind her, the sewing machine paused for a moment—the instant her mother noticed the unnaturally smooth tear—then resumed its sad yet proud rhythm.",
