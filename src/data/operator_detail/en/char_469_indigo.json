My equipment made records of the room's magnetic field when she was casting, and after I removed much of the noise found in normal frequencies, I located a periodical combined waveform transform. This waveform has a certain... effect on the neural system of most living beings. Its effects are very weak, and it is hardly apparent as interference, but it's there. Perhaps this is the reason most of us feel warmth in her light.\nWith her permission, I looked into the inner structure of her Arts Unit. Unlike the Leithanian-made staffs commonly used today, her staff does not have a supporting conduction pathway. Hm... It is actually the Arts Unit on the top of her staff that is really doing the work here. I ran a simulation based on the component's maximum output, and the results show that it could power large facilities such as the massive factories found in Victoria. How did this Unit find itself on Indigo's staff? I discussed this with Thorns, who just happened to be walking by... He seemed to be in a pensive mood after taking a look at my test results and did not say much more. To tell the truth, this isn't like him at all.\nIndigo does not seem to know much more as to the staff's origins as well. All she knows is that it was given to her personally by her teacher when she left her hometown's lighthouse. Therefore, this is as far as my research on this goes for the time being... I really hope that someone will provide me with more information on this in the future.\n—Research recording of Caster Operator Mint",

I guess, between the cake box and the petri dish, she probably picked the wrong thing to eat off of?\nShe told me that, while she was wandering the world, she had by mistake taken on bounties with bounty hunters and dealt in the black markets, where people good and bad alike mingle together. She's made a few 'friends' who know their way around poisons because of that, and perhaps the reason she's able to withstand toxins to such degree is because her body has grown used to getting poisoned over and over. We shouldn't underestimate what the human body is capable of—This is something that we toxicologists always like to say.\nOkay, we've talked for a while now. She should be waking up soon.

If it's daytime, the doors are always wide open for the residents, though very few residents would willingly make their way to the lighthouse. It was too close to the sea, and the adults all heard of the terrors of the sea from their ancestors, before passing them on to their children. Indigo's mother has taught her this many, many times, too. However, she was nonetheless captivated by the peculiar building. Whenever she had some spare time, the first thing that would come to her mind would be to run inside.\nThe lighthouse was where she met her teacher, a quiet, elderly Liberi who nonetheless showed the occasional sense of humor. At first, she refused to become Indigo's teacher and frequently feigned anger to chase away the girl whom she frequently found lying on the rocks next to the shore or climbing atop the lighthouse. In the end, the old Liberi was moved by her sincerity. The old lighthouse keeper needed a successor, and children who were interested in the lighthouse were few and far between. Year after year, the young girl learned much from her teacher. As she learned how to tend to the lighthouse and how to use Originium Arts to serve as its light source, she caught a glimpse of that golden age. She became obsessed with those sceneries of the past, none of which her parents, her neighbors, and her playmates could understand. Before long, she moved into the lighthouse to stay with her teacher and began to care for the lighthouse alongside her.\nOnce, when she pored over the records from those bygone eras, the girl spotted the term 'Guardian of Light.' She jokingly called her teacher one such guardian, and, upon hearing this, her teacher immediately fell silent. Enunciating her sentence word by word, the elderly Liberi told her: at this point, they were more like the guardians of the dark night.\nThe days went by much faster inside the lighthouse than the outside. After a rare rainstorm came and passed one night, her teacher forbade her from entering the lighthouse again. She told Indigo that she must leave her hometown, meet more people, and experience more things before she would be qualified to take over. From then on, Indigo has been on a journey, though she herself knows not how long this journey will last.\nWhat must she discover until she is allowed to return home? It was not until she made her way to Rhodes Island that she finally realized what it was—She needs to find out how to restore the radiance that the lighthouse once possessed.",

We've noticed that these disasters that occur near the coast are noticeably different than the Catastrophes that frequently occur in other areas. We still have yet to be able to make it into several major Iberian cities, but we've already set up numerous offices within its territory near the borders. Our first and foremost goal is still the treatment of Oripathy patients in the nearby areas, but we will continue to monitor and investigate the abnormalities that occur here.\n\n[Classified Log]\nPer your wishes, we've recently managed to obtain some leads, and made contact with some pertinent Iberians. Let's start with the conclusion we've arrived at—Although research on the sea may seem to be a de facto taboo on the surface, it is certainly not a subject matter that's been completely ignored. There is a group of people, including Indigo's teacher, who have been following knowledge that has been passed down to them for generations and making preparations for something. Of course, we don't currently have nearly enough information on this matter, but now that we have leads, we will continue our investigation as necessary.",

      "desc": "When Indigo was still newly arrived on Rhodes Island, we conducted a study on her staff. The unit at its head seemed to be the key to its function, but we could find no clear theory underpinning it. During further studies, new Operators Irene and Lumen—who had visited Engineering to undergo equipment certification—coincidentally passed by, and the latter took one look at Indigo's staff and very confidently told us that he had seen something similar in the 'Eye of Iberia.' The 'Eye of Iberia' is a lighthouse... a series of lighthouses along Iberia's coastal towns, a grand project that once illuminated the whole nation, abandoned altogether after a disaster decades ago, and now a legacy of the age. Indigo's teacher was one of those very lighthouse keepers, and it was he who gave her the staff as she left home.\n'The unit at her staff's head is a standard installation in Iberia's lighthouse systems.' This much should be more or less accurate. The issue was that, based on her account, her teacher protected the Rocky Coast's lighthouse all his life, hoping it would one day shine anew. So why would he give her something so important and then allow her to leave?\nIndigo herself had this to say: 'I'm sure my teacher wanted me to gain some experience on the outside, unravel the secret of its technology, and let it come to life once again... He really was mindful!'\nMeanwhile, Irene stated: 'Will Iberia's lighthouses never shine again without those Ægir relics? Iberia's prosperity should be left up to the Iberians themselves this time.'\nIndigo and Irene's answers undoubtedly represent two different outlooks held by the modern Iberian on the nation's future, and deserve some consideration. However, once they had both left, Lumen raised an alternative, 'small-minded' conjecture, more or less that before an old man sends his granddaughter off to the city, he stuffs the only valuable they own into her suitcase and hopes she'll never come back, or that he'll have passed by the time she does... or thereabouts.\n'The elderly are like that. They like to decide everything for you while you're still clueless,' Lumen added.\nSpeculating on an old man's intentions seemed unnecessary. Besides, having ascertained the history of her Arts unit, our investigation into Indigo was complete. And, of course, it would never have affected how welcome she is at Rhodes Island. But we will note that upon learning the staff's origins, Indigo went blank for a moment. As for what thoughts she had in that instant, and what decisions she made, we have no way of knowing."
