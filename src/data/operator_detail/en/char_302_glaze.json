After a simple modification and the installation of additional parts, this long gun quickly proved its worth in subsequent battles. \nIn Ambriel's words, the only reason she chose this gun was to avoid trouble - she has no desire to engage in close combat with a shorter-ranged gun, nor did she want to lug around the unwieldy components of a modern sniper rifle. \nEven though she uses a weapon that is considered anachronistic for the modern battlefield, because of her low-key nature and relatively inconspicuous position, she basically gets her work done, and therefore the top brass has no reason to find any fault with her.",

She enjoys snacks and desserts, and likes watching simple TV shows and movies with themes that don't require much thought. On her off days, she sometimes meets and chats with other Sankta operators.\nWhen people did notice her, it was mostly about the gun in her hands. Since Operators thoroughly unfamiliar with gun kata would often proselytize its power and benefits, these conversations often escalated into controversy.\nIn this regard, Ambriel would quietly sit down and listen to these discussions, thinking silently to herself: 'Good. Now fight.'",

      "desc": "Ambriel received a mission today. \nA mission it might be, but in reality, it's more like a small request. \nOf course, as the request came from Beanstalk, the reward was enough to make anyone's heart waver: an exquisitely-crafted wooden music box bearing a flowering tree. As soon as she saw that music box, Ambriel thought to herself, there's nobody in this world who wouldn't be charmed by it.\n'Please help me! While I was transporting the little metal crabs, two of them got lost! They're very important to me, so please, I'm begging you!' \nWhen Ambriel went to the location indicated by Beanstalk and set up her equipment, she couldn't help but to think to herself, she never imagined she'd be out in the wilderness trying to catch metal crabs. \n'What the heck even is my job...' \n.......\n Well, whatever. Catching crabs might even be fun. All the infected wild metal crabs I've seen in the past were ugly and troublesome, but I've never seen Miss Beanstalk's crabs before. Maybe they're cute. \nInexplicable thoughts ran through Ambriel's head. \nBut the cute little crabs were not today's main agenda. \nAmbriel activated the equipment around her – the sooner she finished the mission, the sooner she'd get her hands on that wonderful music box. \nShe switched on the power, flipped the switch, adjusted the angle, entered the data, and confirmed her target's information... \nBut there was a problem. The radar appeared to be broken. \nBe it the gibberish on the data output display or the smoking battery, everything was telling her the same bad news. \nIf she had to go back to repair the radar, then she definitely would not be able to complete the mission today, and the music box... She definitely didn't want that... \n...... \n'Ohhhh! I have spare parts here!' \nAmbriel's sudden yelp echoed through the wilderness as she excitedly opened a pack of equipment. Her mood was so good she even broke out into a little hum, finishing the repairs in no time at all and returning to her original mental state. \nAfter re-adjusting the equipment, Ambriel would set up the transceiver and begin releasing her Originium Arts–– \nHmm... This reminds me of tracking down those classmates when they were playing hooky. Now, little crabs, where are you......' \n...... \nA few hours later, the pink-haired Sankta returned to Beanstalk with a breeder box, two little metal crabs rolled up into balls inside. \nIn a box behind her were three fowlbeast eggs of different colors. \nBeanstalk got her metal crabs back, and Ambriel received the exquisite music box, so beautiful that one dared not handle it with anything more than the gentlest of touches. \n'I can't believe it.' Ambriel thought to herself while joyfully looking at the music box. 'I can't believe all that equipment ended up being so useful even off the battlefield.~' \n'Um, excuse me, were you planning on hatching those?' Beanstalk pointed to the fowlbeast eggs. 'If you want to hatch fowlbeast eggs, you'll need an incubator, and you'll have to turn them over frequently...' \n'Is it that complicated?!' \n'P-Please don't just throw them out though! You can ask Miss Vanilla... She'll be able to teach you!'",
