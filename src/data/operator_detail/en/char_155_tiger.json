Indra could barely keep herself conscious, but she used all her will to keep herself together and face the enemy head-on. Here, at the decisive moment, all she ought to need was one more jab.\n'You still want to go?' The calm voice of the opposing party was nearly drowned out by the sound of her own heavy gasps for air.\nLoose silver hairs drooped down across her forehead, blocking her vision and blurring out the golden figure standing firm before her, illuminated by a streetlamp. 'Don't be so quick to call yourself the winner, you little shite! I ain't lost yet!' Indra adjusts her breathing and secretly shifts her center of gravity to behind her left hip, all while gathering her hair firmly behind her shoulders. She raises her fists and clenches her fingers, gripping her shabby brass knuckles even tighter than ever before.\n'I'll help you remember, outsider. This here street's mine—Indra of the Glasgow Gang!' As soon as the words were out of her mouth, the silver figure suddenly steps forward, pouncing upon her opponent faster than the eye could see. She lifts her left fist as if putting every last ounce of strength into this one strike, but then commands her body to turn and instead funnel all that strength into her right fist.\nIndra hears the golden-haired girl mutter in her ear: 'I'll remember alright, Indra of the Glasgow Gang.' A tranquil voice, as she always was. Indra still remembers that after, she lost her balance, she fully expected the cold embrace of the cement road, but that hard sensation looming large in her imagination never came. Through closed eyes, it was like she had... fallen onto a ball of sunshine.\n'Run? Run from what? Sorry Vina, I was daydreaming a bit, didn't hear ya.'\n'How to Fight with the Glasgow Gang. This was your work, wasn't it? Rule Number Four, and this is the most important rule: When it comes time to run, remember to run.'\n'Ah, yeah! Pretty much sums up every street fight I've gotten into over the years.'\n'That night we first met, why didn't you run?'\n'Gonna have to have a think on that one.' Indra lowers her head and contemplates for a moment. 'Back then, whenever we ran from a fight, it was so we could survive. For scroungers on the street, nothing's more important'n staying alive. But...'\n'But?' Siege sits up, facing herself towards Indra.\nIndra raises her head, looking right back at Siege. Under the flickering lights of the boxing gym, two pairs of golden eyes face each other, and she sees herself reflected in the Aslan's eyes.\n'But there's no Feline who doesn't like some time under the sun, right?' Indra draws back the corners of her mouth, impishly baring an ivory grin."
