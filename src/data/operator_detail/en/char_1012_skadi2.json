This is probably your first time meeting her, though for no particular reason. This matter has little to do with any of Rhodes Island's policies, and in the past, I've simply treated it as a personal matter.\nGladiia, Skadi, and Specter are all from Ægir, and are also all Abyssal Hunters.\nMy understanding of the Abyssal Hunters comes from a large amount of data samples, and hopefully Gladiia's information will corroborate the data we have on hand.\nNot awake yet. She has slept for too long. Her body is responding vigorously to the mutation.\nThe Hunters handled the prior Sal Viento incident respectably. Otherwise, many of Skadi's physiological changes will be irreversible.\nMm, I did leave Rhodes Island for a while, indeed as a result of this incident. Skadi's current attire also serves as preparation for sneaking into Iberian territory. Even if Iberia has now fallen to the wayside, this can still be considered a rather risky maneuver. You saw the information I sent you, right?\nDoctor, the Abyssal Hunters and the Ægir have long been fighting against a mysterious entity from the depths of the ocean.\nTerrestrial city-states have close to no understanding of the ocean, and likewise, have no inclination to invest their energy into investigating an unpredictable threat from an unpredictable source.\nHowever, these lifeforms are different from the rare species we've discussed before. I can say with confidence that the threat they pose is real, but not widely-known due to Iberia's decline and Ægir's isolation.\nThe few people in this room are perhaps among the small number of people on land who've caught a glimpse of the truth and still live.\nIf we fail to respond, how many people will lose their lives because of these lifeforms by the time that Oripathy destroys us all?\nThere are many calamities capable of eradicating us, and these lifeforms happen to be one of them.\nI have been wary of this threat for a long time. However, they are far from the vision of the city-states, and I am not strong enough, and my arms cannot reach far enough.\nAnd what does this all have to do with Skadi?\n...My conclusion is, Abyssal Hunters are biologically similar to their archenemies.\nThat is why Specter can combat pollutant-grade Originium for such a long time.\nDoctor, Skadi was awakened by those lifeforms.",

            "storyText": "Abyssal Hunters are a type of weapon.\nThe Hunters attract the monsters of the sea, just as volcanic vents attract thermophilic algae. Sea Terrors rend the flesh of the Abyssal Hunters, as if encountering their 'natural enemies.' The Ægir language has a similar concept.\nWe know slightly more about the Sea Terrors than nothing at all, because we mostly see them when they are already dead.\nSea Terrors are the terminus of all these sea monsters, brutish and mindless.\nI'm ashamed to admit that I've never managed to catch a living Sea Terror. When Sea Terrors are placed into a small and nutrient-rich environment, their cells will stop undergoing apoptosis and autonomously metamorphose. The normal decomposition process does not occur and body tissue rapidly 'degrades,' transforming the Sea Terror into a mass of muscle fibers still capable of full respiration.\nIn other words, they quickly preserve the nutritional value of their bodies and continue to live on, yet die in an individual sense. Detestable, and frightening.\nYou cannot take them captive. If you wish to impose such a word upon them, you are welcome to try.\nWe've also made other discoveries. We hunted these lifeforms many times, and there's one thing I've seen repeatedly.\nAmong them, the individuals with the greatest physiological structure are called the 'Seaborns.' The Seaborns protect the individual organisms. To my understanding, the Seaborns will give their all to this end.\nNo legion will expose its consuls to danger, though the leaders of Rhodes Island may not observe this rule.\nThank you for pointing out my mistake, Kal'tsit. I'll be sure to use a more appropriate metaphor next time.\nIn military operations, a centurion will not voluntarily protect a legionnaire unless it is very important.\nHowever, these lifeforms are different in that all individuals are seen as equally important within the population, and individuals also see all others as having 'equal value.'\nI have never seen them fight over food.\nThere's no difference between the information I can convey and the medical report in your hand. Our science consuls can only do complete lineage tracking of embryonic cells, but Abyssal Hunters are similar to Sea Terrors and Seaborns. Most of our somatic cells are pluripotent.\nThe more frightening thing is that the somatic cells of these lifeforms are constantly mutating, cleverly avoiding deterioration and death. Does this surprise you? Neutral theory and genetic drift are a joke to them, heredity becomes part of the foundation of an individual's development, and the fundamental concept of genes passing from parents to offspring is shattered... Even in the absence of nutrients, this process can continue for a very long time.\nI still haven't described their general physiological characteristics yet, but you can already infer how disturbing they are from just the gist of things, right?\nI would like you to keep your lips sealed about the facts I'm about to tell you. No matter how desperately you try to confide these things to people on land, they will only look at you like you're crazy.\n——Abyssal Hunters also have a similar fate.\nSkadi's physiology is changing drastically.\nHow does individual variation affect the entire population? To be frank... If we did have an answer, then there would not have been a reason for Abyssal Hunters to show up on land. Don't believe me? Then, my explanations today might slightly improve your understanding of how grave the situation is.\nWhat, I didn't disclose the reason for the birth of the Abyssal Hunters?\nI have a strong urge to simply tell you 'I don't know,' but I've always loathed lying. Therefore, I will confess to you: Doctor, at this time, the truth is of no use to you except to worsen your panic.\nI wasn't trying to intimidate the Doctor, Kal'tsit. I was simply offering a sincere word of advice.\nPlease imagine that there is a rather unkind future. At that time, each sea monster is as formidable as a Seaborn or Abyssal Hunter. Their numbers grow endlessly until they dwarf even the grains of sand and drops of rain. The laws of nature we are so familiar with retreat steadily in their wake.\nThey may come up onto land, just as the Abyssal Hunters left the ocean, except the latter did not wish to destroy us. As for them, well...\nI must remind you once again, Doctor. Abyssal Hunters are extremely dangerous. We are dangerous weapons. Some Abyssal Hunters, as they approach the end of their life, will gradually reshape the ecology around them, just as the Seaborns do. This is not something that an ordinary spear or vortex spear can accomplish.\nA portion of the Abyssal Hunters' stamina and physique come from our sworn enemies, and there is only one degree of separation between Skadi and the detestable Seaborn you do not yet know. The same is true for me and Specter.\nIf the only future that awaits us is a tragic one, the fate of Abyssal Hunters can only be more harrowing than that of ordinary people.\nI've told you this much in the hopes that you'll look after Skadi. From Rhodes Island's perspective, she is different from me. You also want to protect her, right?\nAs an Ægir, these are all the secrets I am able to reveal to you, landwalker.\nAnd the reason for all of this is, we have a different connection with those creatures.\nYou might know that saying.

The way they huddle on the bottom of the sea... neglecting their future population. Based on this alone, I might dare to conclude that those who make such bizarre decisions are scarcely different from the vicious rulers on land.\nWake you up? No, I have no such obligation, and if you realize this, that would make things much easier. My response is simply because I hold derision for the many people who deem themselves 'advanced.' Similarly, if you feel like I am trying to fray the relationship between you and someone else, you are welcome to continue that line of thought. Your words should be the clearest, and I couldn't care less about what you think about me.\nSpecter has been ill for a long time, and Gladiia bears the responsibility. There are fleetingly few things they can communicate or reveal to you. However, you also need not be suspicious of them, not that I think you would do that.\nSkadi, I just want to say, don't worry too much about your future.\nWhat defines you is not the dreams you have... but rather what's written here on your medical examination sheet.\nYour thoughts. Your actions. They drive your motivation.\nYou've chosen to end your self-imposed exile. This may be because Rhodes Island has the ability to escape the infiltration and invasion of the Church of the Deep. At least for all these years, no disaster has befallen our operators as a result of you, and that makes you no longer tread as cautiously. Perhaps the efforts of countless operators trying to befriend you have had an effect. You've managed to help them and earn their gratitude. You've established new relationships with them, even if you're busy trying to deny this.\nAs for me, I personally prefer this type of explanation — that is, since you were hired by Rhodes Island, and during the time you've spent here, you've rediscovered your objective and clearly recognized the obstacles in front of your path.\n\nSome of my data indicates that they, the changes in the biological structure of those organisms, are largely limited to cognition. In other words, they are not passive adaptations, but something you can proactively shape. We are fortunate that they have not yet 'progressed' into passive adaptations, but if we do not act, that day will eventually come.\nMm, but this isn't what I wanted to talk to you about today. What I wanted to say is, when they want to adapt towards a certain structure, they will metamorphose in that direction.\nSkadi, if those creatures can become what they want through their own will... you can also use your will to not become something you don't want. You can still do what you want.\n\nFor example, an Abyssal Hunter. Or, something a bit more liberated, a bounty hunter.\nAn operator also isn't a bad idea.\nFurthermore, you are who you are, plain and simple. Skadi. You are yourself. Your job and your role are nothing more than the results of your interests.\n\nYou are not your dreams yet, Miss Skadi.\nThat's right.

      "desc": "The Time has come, He thinks, despite that Time exists no longer.\nThe last distant light extinguishes under His watchful gaze. At His extremities are naught but thin void blacknesses, the stars gone. Amidst space, His half-immaterial body is the lone existence that remains, stretching to infinity, drifting without destination. Ere people had proclaimed Him the end of a cycle; now in this moment He truly is. All else has passed on from being; only He persists.\nSo, what next?\nHe gazes at His own body. The blood kin He once migrated with. The kin He led to blot out countless millions upon millions of lives, all turned part of His body, nourishment for it. Where once clamored countless visions of the future, now lapsed into eternal silence. All this the cost for His life in this very moment, yet in this very moment He knows not what He could use His life for.\nIn yore He had a calling that drove Him to engulf those millions upon millions of lives, and each and every star and satellite they perched on, becoming as every lifeform that had and could have existed in this universe, ultimately drove Him to this shore of oblivion—yet now that once-irresistible calling grows imperceptible, soon to dwindle to nothing. Those hopes that all came to dwell within Him died at the moment where all fell quiet. Even the ones who first blessed Him with this mission may never have imagined this future to follow.\nHe feels lost, uneasy. But nowhere can He seek the answers. Beyond Him is mere void, and within Him purposeless nutrients. Given this, the only place to send His thought can be into the deepest recesses of His body, to stir those aimless nutrients, to try and derive the slightest hint from them.\nUnder His thought's interference, they begin to collide, begin to reconstitute, reform as endless and strange shatterings of information, shatterings that pass away in a blink. So in this Timeless eternity He keeps trying and trying, until His thought finally catches with nimbleness upon a piece altogether familiar to Him—it is a fragment of His own voice, metal threads' vibrations and living membranes' tremors in common harmony... Yes, it is Song.\nOnce, a lone technician had sung this. No matter what seas she swam, it was by herself, trailing hundreds upon thousands of optical cables behind her. The technician deftly strummed these optical cables, and amidst swirling halos sang to schools of indifferent fins that passed her by.\nOnce, a lone wandering singer had sung this too. No matter what lands she walked, it was by herself, trailing tune after tune of memories behind her. The singer wove those memories into ditties, and in rundown inns sang to crowds of indifferent souls.\nIn this moment He Himself is lone, trailing every breadth of creation He engulfed behind Him, drifting through a dying universe to the ends of Time. So in this moment, should He not sing too, to those indifferent nutrients within His body?\nSkadi certainly would. While complex problems still lay on her mind to puzzle through, her Song would well forth—for Song was her language, her imagination, her creation.\nSo Skadi begins to sing. And in her Song, Skadi begins to blossom, more fiercely and ardently than any life that has ever blossomed before. Dimly, Skadi realizes the act she is about to undertake. With the beginning of this Song, those indifferent nutrients within her body will birth new existence, new life, a new universe.\nViolently her body expands, and rapidly her consciousness scatters, and filled with hope she imagines the brand new universe she will never witness."
