Ugh... purse bleeding out. Heart too.\n7th\nShone the whole dang day, might of blown a thermometer, but they got this new flavor of pastry in at my favorite street stall. Lined up an hour and a half in the blazing sun, belly burnt red. Used some ointment from Sora and it worked real well, stopped hurting before I even went to bed.\n10th\nAll clouds. Purchased a new umbrella. Savings blown, be eating instant noodles all next month. Would of been frugal some the past few days if I knew. Got some left over for a rainy day anyway.\n17th\nCloudy but turned clear. Red-braised rib flavor instant noodles taste pretty dang good. Could eat for a whole week without getting sick!\n20th\nClear but turned cloudy. Ate all the red-braised rib ones, just tamagoyaki chive flavor left. It's fine, but I can barely get it down.\n23rd\nI'm all out of instant noodles... not one pot left. Thank all goodness for Texas sharing her cookies. Swear to my starving eyes, for an instant she had holy light beaming round her face.\n24th\nStorming!! Sunny like heaven when I got up. Pedestrians all walked by my umbrella stand, none of them turned an eye, all kept walking. But gloomy clouds rolled in and everyone got caught right out. Drenched to the bone! And I sold out of umbrellas basically instantly. Score!\nKiller profits like that don't grow on trees. Should save it at the bank, play the long game. Always had an idea tucked deep in my heart—get an emporium of my own, right here in Lungmen.\nMaybe time to get started on that. Little sum like this seems like nothing compared to the sky-high rent in Lungmen, but it's a solid start.\n31st\nNew combat boots out, my favorite brand. Shouldn't of done it. Act rash and now nothing but regret. Maybe... Should spend a night reflecting proper on my deeds. I must be a terrible sight when greed goes straight to my head. Life's tough...\n1st\nHey, new combat boots come in real handy! Might of hurt my heart to spend so much, but was worth it. Not a waste, not one bit!"
