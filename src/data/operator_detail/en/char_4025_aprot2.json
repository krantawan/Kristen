You've never held much conversation. You can't even remember what it was like the first time you met him. Yet in some domain, he's your most reliable adviser; you ask him a question, and he'll give you an answer. But when you design to pull him into your social rings, he'll slip quietly out from your hands, hidden in the shadows on interaction's periphery. Not so long ago, Shalem was such a 'friend,' conscientious in his work, humble and gentle in his treatment of others, a proclivity for using his Arts mastery to wipe others' doubts, but at the same time, he tactfully declines all kindnesses, maintaining a distance from every person. Considering Rhodes Island's operators come from all corners, races, temperaments, histories and myriad diversities of the land, there are indeed plenty who are weak with communication yet possess a kind heart, and thus HR's operators haven't had serious concern, vis-a-vis the state of Shalem's life. Actually, Shalem himself hopes he'll lead this sort of life to his biological end, unable to stand recalling his past, his intermittent dreams reminding him his nightmares are still in this world. Thus, he painstakingly avoids any relation with others, hoping that he won't embroil others in it when misfortune descends. He's been waiting forever, waiting for his chapter's end, but he doesn't anticipate that in ten or so months, when Rhodes Island life has long since become routine, that a shadow of the past will sorrowfully arrive.",

He was the most brilliant of those young stars in the troupe, its leader's favorite, a crimson blood diamond, and he stared at him, naturally not seeking to reminisce. To evade that phantasm, Shalem left the squad, fled alone into the barrens, but the black mirage kept behind him close as his shadow. Shalem hid in the city, disguised, changed clothes, and took a circuitous route from a branch office back to Rhodes Island. He thought he'd fooled it, but on returning to his dormitory, he found it had followed aboard, and begun to roam this steel behemoth.\nAn acquainted operator informed him someone called Phantom had joined as an Operator in the past few days. Who was Phantom? Shalem knew in his heart as clear as night.\nEver since, he began making every effort to shrink his range of activity; if there was no need, he wouldn't set half a pace beyond his dormitory. The ghost of the troupe was still wandering aboard Rhodes Island, and should they meet, he would have no way out. Just like this, Shalem disappeared from Rhodes Island for an age...\nWhen he received a mission on his terminal to seek the missing Operator Phantom, Shalem believed someone to be pranking him, but after verifying high and low, he realized Phantom truly had departed Rhodes Island, and no one was more familiar with the mission objective's search area than Shalem.\nIt was his and Phantom's home, and the beginning of their nightmares.\nThe past had already found Shalem, and he could not choose to stay uninvolved again.\nHe accepted the mission to search for Phantom.",

Yes, they handed people money to seek local aid; yes, they carefully selected, adopted many children who were without claim, now their parents had vanished or been lost. Numbering one of them was the young Shalem.\nWhen Shalem and the great huddle of children first saw the troupe's tent, and were taken to their quarters in familiar manner by the butler, given bread from the old man's hands, listened to his cordial questions, their hearts were filled with a hope for the future.\n'You are children of the arts. Now, you may rest well.'\nSo the old butler promised, and so Shalem believed.\nSoon after, his life became a play.\nModest and gentle was the label the troupe gave to Shalem, and ever since then, it has become his 'true personality.'\nWe shan't dwell on the daily physical training and rehearsal of lines. Understudies as excellent as Phantom would be led upon stage, given verbal motivation and material reward in front of them all. And of course, those children not fit for the troupe's demands would be correspondingly denounced.\nEveryone wanted to be the lead on stage with the support of all, and not the failures rebuked before them. And so, on all of their shoulders sat an incorporeal burden.\nNot every child could bear this burden, and though no worries of nourishment nor sleep were had, some still had not the physical power to last upon the stage. Or, perhaps, they were encaged in a role, unable to recover themselves.\nThe children who entered the troupe together one by one disappeared, and those left were completely changed in temperament, not a speck of the innocence of their years left visible.\nAs they grew in years, Shalem had convinced himself to accept one fact:\nWe were only brought into this troupe to offer our lives to the arts. If we are unable to perform...\nThen we have no right to live within the troupe.\nWhether voluntary or not, so long as you joined the troupe, the script you were given would be written long in advance.\nTo run until your life's end.\n......\nIn his dreams, Shalem watches the traveling troupe's performances with his parents, and their performance is of a one-of-a-kind vast flood, submerging everything. Only a few survivors remain, pulling through atop the mountains. Survival drives all to the brink, and they who ought to have worked together past these difficulties began to slaughter each other. In the end, no one escapes. Only a few uneaten slices of meat remain, scooped away by fowlbeasts, flapping their wings across the endless waters.",
