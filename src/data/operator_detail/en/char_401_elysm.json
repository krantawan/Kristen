According to his own account, he did consider becoming a messenger prior to joining Rhodes Island, a career plan that is now on hold. \nIn fact, Elysium's sense of direction is so strong that he can remember any place he's ever been to, as well as being able to mentally map out a course of action with surprising accuracy. However, the maps that he comes up with often are not cost-efficient or practical, and he sometimes has to simplify these routes to facilitate better understanding and realizability — and yet, none of this meticulousness is carried over to his daily life.",

He values the relationships between team members far more than Operators who prefer to work alone; therefore, any conflict between members is the last thing he wants to see. \nElysium's mere presence during a mission is enough to improve a team's morale and facilitate a more relaxed atmosphere. Though he often fails to recognize his own contribution in maintaining the harmony of a team, he always manages to elicit some very memorable reactions. When operators with clashing personalities have to be assigned to the same team due to special circumstances, the operation leader will often consider adding Elysium to keep the operation moving forward smoothly.",

A Special Ops team's line of work can be very dangerous, and Elysium's role during these operations is sometimes even more important. The transmission device he carries with him needs to be paired with his Originium Arts in order to achieve the greatest effect, and the tacit synergy between Elysium and his direct superior can sometimes be the key to victory. \nTo say that his job is to provide courage itself is, in my opinion, not an exaggeration. But this courage is not the flag-waving kind that gets people riled up before they charge off to war, but rather something more practical. \nWhen operators such as Elysium are present on the battlefield, the commander can better focus on understanding the overall situation, and individual operators can fight with the peace of mind that the operation plan is being executed. Some special operations even hinge on the state.' \n—Dobermann",

It can be said that the duo's unbreakable trust is a product of their ability to fit together in all aspects, as well as years of cultivating their relationship. \nAs the captain of one of Rhodes Island's special squads, the leader has a very special ability. This ability often provides unexpected and valuable effects in combat, but poses a hindrance in daily life. Only through Elysium's assistance is the leader able to normally communicate with others, and this responsibility may perhaps be the reason why Elysium chose to stay in Rhodes Island. \n\n'Even though it seems like he's always getting smacked around, they're actually on very good terms.' \n'Smacked around? Is the leader of the 3rd Squad such a vicious person?' \n'Hmm, I wouldn't say that. The leader's actually an introverted person, despite trying to maintain a cool and calm appearance... Whatever happens, it's usually because Elysium is such a pain in the ass!' \n—Conversation between a member of the 3rd Squad and a member of the HR Department\n\nOnce Elysium has recognized someone as reliable, he will display his trust in his own special way, which may manifest in the form of nonsensical dialogue, or through increasingly preposterous bets. In this regard, 'comrade' has a very special meaning for Elysium, and this is not a term that he uses lightly. \nTaking everything in consideration, none can deny that Elysium is an excellent teammate and a reliable partner on the battlefield, even if he can be a bit annoying.",
