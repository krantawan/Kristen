Scientists have found that by combining biological theory with the experience of engineering, they are in a better position to solve various problems encountered in the fields of biology and medicine. This new discipline quickly became closely linked to the practice of medicine. \nEspecially for a company like Rhodes Island that seeks to develop drugs to inhibit and treat Oripathy, a bioengineering laboratory can be said to be a necessity. \nHowever, even if Rhodes Island offers a favorable salary compared to the rest of the industry, it is well-known as a pharmaceutical company that specializes in Originium research and Oripathy treatment. Naturally, these are subjects that would discourage most people. \nBut even setting this point aside, the fact that Rhodes Island needs to be mobile, and the existence of tech companies such as Rhine Lab that can provide a better baseline, has caused Rhodes Island to be at a disadvantage when competing for talent. \nFurthermore, Rhodes Island is not purely a pharmaceutical company, and many prospective employees decide to leave after learning about Rhodes Island's true purpose. \nAll in all, despite the considerable successes of Closure's Engineering Department in attracting a vast amount of talent, Rhodes Island's recruiting efforts are far from enough to meet the scope of the challenges. Closure can often be heard complaining about these difficulties, but she knows that there is little that can be done to improve the situation. \nDespite these conditions, there is, according to Closure, one department that she never has to worry about, and that is the Bioengineering Department led by Weedy.",

            "storyText": "While people have joined Rhodes Island from the various corners of Terra, a bioengineer from Iberia is a strange sight indeed. \nFirst, as everyone knows, Iberia has been blocked off from the rest of the world. \nSecond, though completely unsubstantiated, is the idea that Iberia is some backwards and xenophobic place. \nIn fact, the inverse is true. Setting aside the complicated relationship between Laterano and Ægir, Iberia is a land full of flair and friendly to scientific research, although this friendship is conditional. \nA tacit understanding exists within the scientific community that one is free to conduct whatever research they choose within certain fields; and undeniably, Iberia has made substantial achievements in these fields. However, some fields of research are completely forbidden; or perhaps more accurately, in Iberia, those fields of research do not exist. \nTo do justice to the modern history behind this situation would require an entire encyclopedia's worth of writing, so I will omit that here. However, bioengineering does exist in Iberia, or Weedy would not have been able to become an expert in the field at such a young age. Naturally, this was a result of her continuing her family's research. \nAdmittedly, the above description makes it sound as if Weedy is seeking asylum in Rhodes Island to escape persecution, but this is actually a necessary background explanation based upon existing intelligence. \nWeedy joined Rhodes Island simply because she no longer wanted to stay in Iberia, and wished to see more of the world. According to her own account, there were virtually no barriers to her leaving, but she was also told that it would be significantly more difficult to return to Iberia - to which she had no particular sentiments. She received an offer from Rhodes Island shortly before receiving an offer from Rhine Lab. \nWeedy is not shy about mentioning her belief that Rhine Lab is better suited to her work than Rhodes Island is, but whenever this topic is brought up, she will tack on the phrase, 'but I think Rhodes Island is pretty good too.'\nOf course it is. Otherwise, she wouldn't have chosen to set foot upon the battlefield either.",

Even now, there are no shortage of scientists who specialize in studying the Infected, but with the intention of proving through various means that they are of inferior birth or even deserving of death. \nEven in Rhodes Island, there are a number of researchers who only recently overcame their fear of the Infected, and still have not reached a point where they can address those individuals with kindness. \nIf this is true even among scientists who are supposed to represent the bleeding edge of knowledge, what are we to think about the beliefs of ordinary people? Sometimes, reality can be crushingly disappointing. \nHowever, there are also people like Weedy. \nHer abilities would have allowed her to find a better work environment, but she chose to stay with Rhodes Island. Her only demand towards people she is communicating with is that they remain tidy, and she does not care if they are infected or not. She is not particularly talkative, but she does attempt to use her technological expertise to help people within her means, such as making small gadgets or toys for them. \nEven her reason for joining the battlefield is as simple as it is moving:\n'Is there anything I can do for them?

In the meantime, I'm attempting to remodel the Bionic Seadragon—strengthen connectivity between the internal conductor unit and water cannon lock-on system. In future battles, with support from Leaf and his friends, the water cannon's going to be much more accurate.\n\nBionic Seadragon Development Log 04\nBeen asked by an operator about the names again. It really is just for differentiating. Fundamentally, using '-1' or '-X' or '-β' on their serials would be fine, but using names like Leaf makes things a little more convenient... I don't really get what everyone's so curious about.\n\nBionic Seadragon Development Log 06\nTwo Bionic Seadragon core components damaged, can't be reused. Seems I'll have to iterate on their entirety. Closure wants to take the opportunity to customize them, and I refused. Lancet-2 and Castle-3 are very cute, and Operator Mayer's Meeboos have very fun interaction patterns, but I can't picture Leaf and his friends fitted with voice modules. They're doing fine as is.\n\nBionic Seadragon Development Log 09\nI've had contact with new onboards Operator Irene and Operator Lumen, so roughly got the picture of what's happened and what's happening in Iberia. The locked drawers are opened wide. As the forbidden zones start to expand, any 'secrets' will automatically reveal themselves to the people, and cause either a crisis that'll take everyone's collective effort to deal with, or a nightmare no one could escape... Sealing it away is meaningless now. No one can stand forever on the shore.\nOperator Irene took note of Leaf—not for her functionality, obviously. She's sharp for a young Inquisitor. The Bionic Seadragon was indeed created referencing designs handed down within my family. I've conjectured how those designs were formed, what they represent, what special meaning they hold, what information they hide. Perhaps I should say, what they were modeling... Of course, since leaving Iberia, they haven't been very meaningful conjectures, or very concrete. What if they do have something to do with my family, and Iberia, and the ocean's past? More importantly, with the tide surging onto the land, is there any possibility it could concern the future?\n......\nMaybe I should go have another talk with Irene. Maybe I should add a few new items to the Bionic Seadragon research project."

      "desc": "'From a scientific perspective, this great land we presently inhabit is abundant with mediums of complex composition. Here on Terra, the medium is commonly known as air, and it isn't substantially different from the liquid medium filling the ocean. Ægir living in inland Iberia often make use of their analogous knowledge of the sea to produce toys like this, that drift unimpeded through the air.'\nSuch was the answer Weedy gave, when the operators of Rhodes discovered the N.B.P. floating about in a cabin, to explain the origins of the seemingly unattested equipment.\n'Is it some kind of common sea custom?'\nWeedy silently watches the prototype lilt back down to the ground. The urge hit her out of nowhere to tell them that Iberia wasn't nearly the seaside place most thought of it as, but had vast and arid lands to its name as well. Still, even at Rhodes Island, some were still caught up in the impression of stiffness that the tense, fiercely isolationist nation tended to leave.\nShe folded up the N.B.P.'s soft wings and stowed it back in its box. 'To clarify, I've never been back to the sea before, and don't know much about the Ægir. Like you, I've never been to Ægir itself either. I may have been born an Ægir, but what I know is sandstorms, misty dawns and thick jungles, the dry inland—less so the coral on the coast. When I was still young, I went out into our desertified lands with my mother, using bioengineering to treat it with technology. When we had downtime from our field work, she'd fly toys like these for us to run after. There wasn't any kind of special significance to it—it was just a pastime.'\nShe thought back to her home soil of Iberia. The Profound Silence was merciless in revising their place in the country, especially after the Inquisition 'visited' their doorstep to forbid the family from 'spreading dangerous Ægir technology.' As far as most Ægir living in Iberia were now concerned, 'Ægir' was no more than the name that branded them, and ever more vaguely at that.\n'You already had bionic technology this developed back then?'\n'What you see here is actually a successor model I made recently. It now has the propulsion capacity to 'float' in quicksand, and... also some flaws.' With that, Weedy picked up the box and left the cabin.\nOnly she knew that this improved model, the spitting image of an aquatic creature, had lost all ability to enter the water."
