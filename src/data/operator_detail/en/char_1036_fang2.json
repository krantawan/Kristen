She's grown taller, her taste in equipment leans even further towards practicality, and she goes on more field missions than before. The smile on her face has also dimmed somewhat, but that is not to say that she has become cold-hearted. She is simply more reserved, more reliable, and more resolute. She has experienced partings and witnessed tragedy, and is always trying her best to stay calm and cool-headed. Only in the most extraordinary of circumstances does her facade break. When asked about her changes, she said: 'This is how a team captain should act.'\nNot everything about Fang has changed, though. She's just as good at observing her teammates as she ever was, able to analyze their combat habits and preferred tactics. Her enthusiasm towards her work, her care for her teammates, and her adaptability in unexpected situations haven't changed either. Thanks to this, after formally becoming an operator, she was assigned to lead a field team of her own. She continues to learn and accumulate experience, taking on the duty of growing alongside her comrades.",

            "storyText": "The reserve operators have noticed a female Kuranta hanging around the training room recently. At times, Instructor Dobermann will allow this operator named Fang to act as her assistant and help prepare exercises for them. At first, everyone was wary of this new instructor. The reason was simple: like Dobermann, she rarely spared time for jokes or small talk, and many first took her to be practically a clone of Dobermann. But in truth, this hard-to-approach assistant instructor was a kind-hearted veteran operator good at expressing her care for the younger generation.\nOne time, a reserve op team ended a combat exercise with only crushing defeats. That night, they nervously awaited Fang's admonishment—they were unfamiliar with her as she only returned to Rhodes Island between missions, and only saw her as assistant instructor. But the reality was the opposite of their expectations. Upon seeing her trainees lowering their heads in silent guilt over their mistakes in the mock combat, the first thing she did was tell them not to worry. Then, she took the time to break down what every trainee did right as well as where they were lacking, before concluding with a few suggestions for their daily training. Since then, she often talks to the trainees outside of training, and even gives advice on unrelated issues in their lives.\nTo go from a childish student to an operator able to command her own team, one needs not only a strict training regimen, but a resolute heart. As Fang would gladly share, that's something all Rhodes Island operators need to experience for themselves. After all, it took her own experiences to finally understand it herself. Ace had supported her over the years, along with many others like Dobermann. Their influence has had a profound effect on her growing up. Now, she takes up her calling as an operator in her own way.",

Every time she returns, she seeks out her old friends from Reserve Op Team A1 to chat about old times, but since everyone now has their own duties, it's rare for them to reunite. Fang always brings them back gifts after a mission, entrusting them to Logistics so the others can pick them up at their convenience. Since she started doing this, she's received more than a few in return. Beagle gave her a pauldron that she and the Engineering operators made during their defensive equipment research, and she wears it to this day. Lava gave her a peculiar Arts unit consisting of three loops, a design of her own make that came to her in a flash of inspiration. Fang wears it on her belt. Hibiscus gave her a purple ribbon she says can be used as a bandage in emergencies. Fang has pinned it to her chest. Kroos gave her two unusually-shaped badges, claiming they were the products of researching one of her 'magic trick' traps. Fang has them attached to the strap of her lance. Through this peculiar display, the former members of A1 show their care for one another. No matter where she goes, Fang always wears them.",

They were scattered.\nShe sees herself in battle. She fights her way through the melee, rushing to high ground, where she fires a Rhodes Island signal flare.\nHer team puts their Arts to use against the mercenaries while providing the villagers a means of retreat.\nFlames, explosions, arrows, swords, blood, crumbling houses, shattered glass, weeping children.\nShe runs and runs, never stopping. From one end of the street to the other.\nShe sees mercenaries collapsing while she fights on. She shouts at her fellow operators, telling them to retreat and seek help.\nThe mercenaries rush her, but she does not fall back.\nAnd then. And then...\nShe jolts awake from her nightmare, the pain in her abdomen continuing to wrack her body, before falling into a deep sleep once more.\nThrough the haze of slumber, she sees the concern on Hibiscus's face, and hears a few indistinct words. Hibiscus's face slowly becomes clearer, and she begins to smile.\n'Sleep,' she says. 'You protected everyone, just like you always have. Now sleep. You did good.'\nAmidst the fog of dreams, Fang does as she is told.",

'I'm more than glad to take on the responsibility, but I'm worried I'm not qualified to lead.' She confided these thoughts to her teammates.\nOne night, during a combat simulation, Reserve Op Team A1 was completely 'annihilated.' At the time, Fang had discovered a flaw in the opponent's tactics and thought that if she ran fast enough, she could penetrate deep behind enemy lines to split their attention and reduce the suppression fire on Beagle, thus creating more space and time for her team to retaliate. So she changed the strategy on-the-fly and used something her teammates had never practiced. The result: Team wipe. Even Fang was sent to the sickbay for treatment.\n'Why did you push yourself like that?' asked Ace, an elite operator who had taken the time to guide the rookies.\n'Because I'm the captain, so I have to take responsibility for the entire team.'\n'Responsibility, huh...? Responsibility.'\n'Sir, if you were leading the team, what would you have done?'\n'I'd have gone with a safer strategy.'\n'Why?'\n'Don't be hasty. Observe, act, and accumulate experience. That's what I always do.'\n'But you're already an elite capable of leading entire squads.'\n'Which is why I know full well that, on the battlefield, a commander only has one chance to bear full responsibility.' The man falls silent for a moment. ' So we ought to use it wisely.'\n'I don't quite understand, but I'll try to keep that in mind.' Fang continued, 'So please teach me to be a better captain! I'll commit to it, no matter how much work it takes!'\n'Let's continue this conversation once you've recovered from your injuries, young captain.' Ace waved goodbye before leaving.\nFollowing this incident, Fang indeed underwent rigorous training. When all was said and done, Ace handed her a box and told her this: 'For a captain, the most important thing is to remain calm and collected. Your long-term training task is learning to be patient. And your reward for that is here in this box.'\nAs for what happened next...\nFang snaps back to reality and re-evaluates her current status. On the day she became an official operator, she felt she wasn't ready. On the day she received her second promotion, she still felt she wasn't ready. Now, she is about to head to Londinium to support the operators there. She has been through dozens of operations, some easy, some dangerous. Some short, some long. She has overcome difficulties and experienced failure. Now, she feels she has finally finished her training task and tempered herself.\nShe opens the box and finds a pair of wind protection glasses with a note inside:\n'May you always keep your eyes on your duty and forever be dauntless.'"
