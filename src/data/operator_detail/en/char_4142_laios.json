Our records have come up empty, so all we can do is document these names for now. Perhaps they are an incredibly skilled theater troupe touring the land with elaborately designed backstories. Or maybe these places are extremely remote, and they have been drifting across Terra until they stumbled upon Rhodes Island. They lack much common knowledge about things everyone here is familiar with, such as Arts and nomadic cities. Their amazement at our cafeteria suggests life has been very harsh for them.\nPerhaps this explains why they excel in fighting and survival in the wild, even in unfamiliar environments. They have a remarkable caster, surveyor, and logistics-slash-combat specialist in their squad. Laios, their leader, seems quite average by comparison, perhaps even a bit dim-witted. Yet, given how much his team trusts him, he might possess hidden talents of his own?",

While his basic combat skills do not match our top operators, he can quickly identify the traits and weaknesses of any wildlife. He also possesses impressive courage, often taking the first step in encounters, and quick thinking when resolving crises.\nAccording to operators who have gone on missions with him, Laios's keen ability to analyze wildlife stems from his boundless curiosity. He is constantly observing and learning about creatures, meticulously keeping notes. When facing an unfamiliar creature, he rapidly consults his internal catalog of similar animals to pinpoint their weak points. It seems that he was already a wildlife fanatic in his hometown, although they refer to creatures as 'monsters' for some reason.\nHowever, numerous complaints have accompanied his performance records. Laios is often distracted by unfamiliar creatures during lulls in combat, requiring other operators to keep his strange behavior in check. Many crises he resolves are in fact caused by his own curiosity. Additionally, he frequently invites operators to join his observations and experiments, causing headaches for many team captains despite their urging him to stop. Laios has also shown a deep interest in our operators themselves while aboard the landship. His curiosity about their physical features has led to chaotic incidents. Though Marcille and others managed to tie him up and issue a formal apology, many operators remain traumatized and now require regular counseling sessions.\nEven Mon3tr has not escaped his observations; his daring touch earned him a vicious beating. Remarkably, when carted into Medical afterwards, he still wore a satisfied smile.\nIn a sense, Laios may be the most dangerous person aboard Rhodes Island.",

He is extremely poor at picking up on subtle social cues and body language, often imposing his own obsessions onto others while failing to notice their tactful rejections.\nCountless incidents have occurred where operators tried to stop his 'creative ideas' involving wildlife, but all to no avail. They can only watch helplessly as he stomps into a huge nest of wild metal crabs or 'Pompeii's' lair.\nThough he always seems rather regretful afterward, everyone knows it won't stop him the next time he gets a wild idea.\nOne memorable incident led to a unique friendship between an operator and Marcille after they gave Laios a joint dressing-down. That night, while writing up the mission report, the operator heard Marcille's perspective: though Laios isn't good with people, he is still a kind, upstanding young man who has never accepted injustice. When his sister was treated unfairly, he threw away his position as a lord's heir and left home. Out of a sense of responsibility, he has always supported his former party members financially while they were injured.\nDuring his travels across Terra, Laios has encountered many people who survive by fair or foul means. When it comes to determining right from wrong, his heart may have long known the answer. After learning of Rhodes Island's mission and the challenges it faces, he quickly became fond of our organization and the operators striving to make our goals a reality, gladly counting himself as one of us.",

He understands how dangerous an unknown creature can be, so at critical moments, he remains the calmest of all.\nWhy have I written him such a favorable report? It seems that I, just like the rest of his party, have also seen the appeal of this 'leader' of theirs.\n\nAddendum: Damn you, Laios! The fool noticed some rare variant of Originium slug on a mission and sneaked it into his rucksack. It managed to escape after his return to the landship, and now Logistics is in complete disarray.

A set of hand-drawn how-tos by Laios for use in combat, one for the mock-gloompincer (imitate mandibles with the arms as a deterrent) and one for the mock-Originium slug (arch the body and imitate pricking with the hands). The gloompincer chart also has a small annotation to the side: 'could be interpreted by male gloompincers as a mating ritual.'\nSKETCH OF MON3TR. Multiple hand-drawn sketches of Mon3tr from different angles by Laios. Finely rendered, but the abdomen and claws are given a jarring level of detail, possibly suggesting he had the chance to observe up close while being grabbed by Mon3tr. Small annotation to the side: 'so cool!'\nA FEATHER. Confirmed by Zumama to be from the High Priest, who has filed with Rhodes Island for a restraining order. Nevertheless, countless operators report seeing the High Priest waiting in areas Laios frequents, and even perching on his head. HR operators suspect the High Priest may actually be enjoying the attention.\nSEEDS. Sami silencing chestnut seeds (P.S. works on Marcille), Rim Billitonian bottletree fruit (P.S. is swimming in the tree trunk possible?), Iberian seagrass roots (P.S. tongue numb after taste), etc. Doodle on a note to the side of a walking mushroom, with... the head of an Originium slug?\nSEA TERROR IN A BOTTLE. A small Sea Terror kept in a bottle. Laios occasionally feeds it different things to test what it eats, and observes how it is able to change form in such a short time. Unfortunately, this one hasn't demonstrated even the slightest metamorphosis, which has more than saddened Laios.\n \nLaios had a spot in his armor where he could nestle these items safe and sound, but in a tragic turn of events, Marcille spotted his Sea Terror during feeding time, and then everything else too, ending in the forcible disposal of the entire bundle by her hands.\nOperators at the scene report that Laios was 'like a hoarding musbeast who had a year's worth of food soaked by rain,' and simply walked away down the corridor with his head hung low. He contacted HR and relayed the day's events out of concern for the repercussions, following which we discovered the Sea Terror in a standard wastebin in an ordinary Rhodes Island hallway.\nPursuant to this, HR has elected to commend Marcille for her safety awareness, and to act on an immediate and pressing need to put Laios through safety training.",
