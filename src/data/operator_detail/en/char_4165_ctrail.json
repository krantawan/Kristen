This is why when she first joined Rhodes Island, most only knew her as a new face. Few knew her name or what department she was attached to, let alone her interests or her past.\nThe first time she managed to make a deep impression on the others was during an ordinary meeting. At the time, the landship's guide signs were being updated, and the Logistics operator in charge wanted to know if they were clear and easy to follow. Several operators were queried for their feedback, and as it happened the first operator asked was Contrail.\n'All I wanted was to get the opinion of a newcomer first. I don't think she expected to be called up, and man was her face red as she stuttered and stammered. Couldn't understand a word she said, either. She just stood there... If it wasn't for someone else stepping in with their own feedback, I don't know how long that awkward moment would have gone on.'\nThe next day, the project lead received a neatly-written document filled with detailed feedback, including many photos taken off the ship. Contrail mentioned these were all signs she saw during her travels, and included them as reference.\nThere is another thing that gets our operators talking about Contrail. One day, an operator out on the deck for some fresh air raised their head and happened to see her flying overhead.\n'At first, I thought my eyes were giving out, or I was in some crazy dream! At least, until I noticed it was Contrail.\n'It's not that I think her flying skills are <i>that</i> crazy. It's just that the dawn light let me get a good look at her face, and, well, I've never seen her looking so comfy... I can tell she really loves flying.'",

Her parents were biologists by trade, and often had to travel all across Terra to observe wild animals in their natural habitat, with the young Contrail in tow. She was an extremely timid child, though. Even the footsteps of burdenbeasts were enough to make her cry. Her parents would call for her to join them in observation, but all she wanted to do was to stay in the tent by herself. She recoiled in the face of everything, and was deeply uninquisitive. Despite her parents' best efforts to provide her with an encouraging education, she remained so. But they always believed that one day, their daughter would find something she truly loves.\nShe eventually did, as they expected, but the experience that led to it is incredibly hard to believe.\nIt was a perfectly normal morning. Her parents had just finished their nighttime observation, and returned to their tent to find Contrail missing. In a panic, they searched everywhere for her, only to raise their heads and see her up in the sky. She was being held aloft in the beak of a gigantic fowlbeast, 'soaring' through the sky.\n'Mom and Dad were out of their minds with worry waiting for it to set me down, but I was having the time of my life... I'd never felt that excited before.\n'I remember being really scared when it picked me up, so scared I forgot to close my eyes. Then I saw those scary trees and ferocious beasts shrink until they were smaller than my finger. I saw the sun and the clouds get closer and closer. I saw where the barrens stopped being the barrens, where they turned into prairies and villages...\n'Without really thinking about it, I opened up my arms and started swaying them back and forth... just like a fowlbeast.'\nFrom that day onwards, the girl loved the sky.",

They led her on fowlbeast observations, following these free-wheeling creatures as they migrated. While she helped her parents in their observational research, she also began studying flight dynamics, continuing her studies into university. Through her own efforts, she managed to upgrade a portable flight device to be capable of short flights alongside flying fowlbeasts.\nContrail continues to perform test flights all over Terra to realize her dream of long-distance flight all the sooner, and Rhodes Island has become the platform from which she can chase her dreams. The Engineering operators are already used to the odd ideas she would occasionally propose—for example, adding colored smoke bombs to her flight device's nozzles, or making the joints of her Originium air thrusters magnetic... In short, whenever she sequesters herself in a workshop to tinker in silence, everyone knows she's figured out where she wants to fly to next.\nIt's true that achieving her dream will not be easy, but no matter how many times she stumbles, Contrail always picks herself back up again, facing the storm before her without a hint of fear. Perhaps one day, she will finally be able to accompany the flocks of fowlbeasts as they migrate across Terra, just like how they accompanied her when she was young.\n\n[Clip from a wildlife documentary]\nChanges to the environment caused by Catastrophes and human activity are never-ending, and we have noted that the migratory patterns of wild animals change along with them. A farflyer fowl's migration is a typical example. For the past few centuries, it was very rare to see them outside of Columbia and Siesta, but in recent years, researchers have found traces of them migrating, nesting, and breeding in places such as Victoria and Rim Billiton.\nThe reason we never stop observing their migratory routes is because migration is an inevitability for humanity as well. Conflicts, Catastrophes, poverty... Because of this, we can understand, even sympathize with the fowlbeasts. They may go, but they promise they will return.",
