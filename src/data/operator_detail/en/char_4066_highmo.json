Even Dr. Kal'tsit was still in talks with Iberia...\nThough we always say we can't ignore a wounded patient in need, we're still responsible for the safety of the other personnel after all. If it weren't for Amiya using her power and guaranteeing that Highmore was different from those appalling creatures, we wouldn't have known what to do. I even heard that Medical faced some technical difficulties when operating on her wounds and the hyperplastic tissues?\nThat's not all. After the surgery, Mizuki even requested us to accept her as an operator, to allow her to once again experience life amongst people... We weren't the only ones surprised, I'd wager even Amiya couldn't hide her astonishment, and Tulip was next to her just coughing lightly.\nAs for me? Well, I ended up being the one in charge of arranging and recording her test results. ...No, I don't think there was anything worth remembering or discussing, especially not her weapon impact tests on bionic dummies.

Whether it was her father being spirited away by the Inquisition under the pretense of his Ægir identity, never to return, or her mother gradually becoming mute in the few remaining years of her life before finally dying of despair, their departures left an irreparable mark in her life.\nSurprisingly, she does not seem to harbor any grudge or regret towards the Inquisition. Instead, she blames the townsfolk for falsely accusing her father to save their own skins, the neighbors for spreading false rumors of her mother's alluring voice, and herself for being helpless to change anything yet unable to let go.\nShe directs her hatred toward human weakness rather than ill will, and perhaps that is why she continues to wallow in remorse and shame to this day.",

Yet, I swear I saw starlight through the window. It formed a humanoid body, looking grand and divine, with bright blue stars marking an old man's joints. They fluttered around like spores in the wind, while lines of starlight coalesced into blood vessels. Countless moist and vibrant organisms converged harmoniously, drawing out the lines and contours of a human body.\nWhen the old man raised his arm, it was like a bite had been taken out of the crowd. Where his hand passed, there remained no noise, nor any marks, or even bloodstains. The wriggling starlight consumed all violence, leaving only silence in its wake.\nWhen the entire street was fully illuminated by starlight—it took but a moment—the grandpa, the bishop, started walking towards me. Behind him flowed a living carpet, or a cape, or something, formed of nothing but the stars and the ocean.\nIt was serene, beautiful, brilliant. Ah, so this is what humans should really be like...\nI, too, wish to join that patch of starlight.",

However, within such imagination, the term 'humanity' eminently excludes the Infected, the impoverished barely able to eke out a living, the wanderers without a home in the wilderness, the Sarkaz branded with the epithet of evil, and we of Ægir. Such massive-yet-myopic idealism does not even include the land and the sea humans rely on to live, nor the flora and fauna that are reduced to mere resources. It contains only humans, and the creations they pride themselves upon.\nThis irrationality stems from the weakness and inefficacy of humanity, their inequality and distrust. Only by shedding our laziness and degeneration, by shattering our biases in the pursuit of evolution, can we finally realize the value of a human being.\nOh, Highmore.

      "desc": "This is not the first time I bring you out to sea. You've heard countless ocean tales from me.\nYou already know how the tides flow, and how they ebb. You know that when pale blue light shines in the surface, you are no longer to bother the fins and seabeasts. You know that when the pinnacle of Oberos Lighthouse touches the very top of the Shadow-Moon, we Ægir should return home.\nYou are familiar with the skyscraping surges, and the smallest of sprays. You've learned to converse with them, haven't you? You love to chatter with them, and they are glad to tell you how they are feeling. Do you still remember what they told you? They are but one part of the sea; they are one and the same. You know where the surges will stop and rest, and you know where the tiniest suds will assimilate into the ocean. I have nothing left to tell you now. Hence, this time will be very different; you must prepare yourself, and you must listen to me.\nWe are familiar with the earth and ocean; they have made me and my vessel old, unable to reach farther places. You see? The briny winds dry my cheeks, the air erodes at my bones, the starlight presses down on my shoulders, and if not for you, even lifting this oar would likely be beyond me. But you are different. Your arms are still growing, your bones and flesh are sturdier than mine, your eyes livelier, and your thoughts brighter. You should make it to higher, farther waters. Young child, you must sail far. Child, this sea will be very different. Gone will be the fins you know, gone will be the fearsome seabeasts, and there will be no lighthouse to guide your way, as your destination is in the seas beyond where the stars shine... However, still there will be tides there, still there will be waves, and still there will be countless glimmering specks of ocean foam just like you, Highmore. I trust that, just as before, you will be familiar with these new tides, and familiar with these new waves. They will tell you stories even I haven't heard. You must accompany the twin moons—no, you must go somewhere higher, farther, vaster than the twin moons...\nThe meaning of a voyage is not mine to give, for you will find it yourself. But first you must remember, Highmore, remember what I've told you. A voyage is by no means a retreat, and the reason we leave our home is by no means our disappointment with it. Your voyage is because you are young, because you are sturdy, and because it is for a home as young and hope-filled as you. Once you have seen tide upon tide, seen wave upon wave, you must return home, and you must return to tell us.\nHighmore, a voyage is not a farewell. You must remember, remember your anchor, for so long as you have your anchor, your vessel will be sure to make landfall; so long as you have your anchor, you, voyaging child, will be sure to return home.",
