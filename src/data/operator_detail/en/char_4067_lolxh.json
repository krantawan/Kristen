He came to Rhodes Island accompanied by his friends Xiaobai and Ah Gen, along with a rare creature named Biu. When the three first arrived, they were unwilling to fully disclose their experiences due to their wariness of strangers and the new environment. However, by piecing together the clues that they invariably let slip, it can be determined that Xiaohei and his friend Ah Gen have an extremely special ability to cast Arts without the use of Originium, and this ability—that they call 'Spirit Ability'—has never been recorded in any official Terran records. This attracted many curious operators to attempt to learn it as well, but without exception they all failed to do so.\nIt appears that Xiaohei's Spirit Ability can not only alter the physical properties of metals and freely manipulate them at high speeds, he can also track enemies based on the position of metallic objects and cause interference by vibrating metal pieces to create noise. Besides this, he also has an astonishing long-range teleportation ability, which lets him quickly change his and other operators' location in a short amount of time. Whether it be casting range or strength, Xiaohei's abilities are truly remarkable, but he is still young and has yet to receive any systemic education. It can be said that he has a great amount of untapped potential.",

His cute outer appearance has drawn many people to him with the intention of making friends. Though the stony face he puts on when interacting with others has deterred many people, it's not a sign of his rejection, but merely his attempt at showing off a reliable side of himself. Most of the time, that little bundle of black leaping onto your shoulder is enough to tell you that he's already begun to accept you as a partner. If you find yourself with a conspicuous lack of little black bundles, please try to recall if you have recently rubbed his ears without permission.\nXiaohei spends most of his time together with his friends Xiaobai and Ah Gen. Unlike the quiet Xiaohei, the lively Xiaobai and talkative Ah Gen are much easier to approach, and befriending them may increase Xiaohei's affection towards you. Besides that, sparring with him in the Training Room is a surefire way to get closer, especially if you bring along some tasty snacks and share them with him.",

It's difficult to imagine the amount of effort and hard work Xiaohei has put in towards his goal. However, after meeting Xiaobai and Ah Gen, he has put a lot more thought into the things he wants to do, wishing to study and play with his friends, or travel to faraway places and meet many new people. Regarding these dreams, we are willing to provide as much assistance as possible to support his growth into the person he wishes to become.\nNote\nThough Xiaohei has performed well in missions, not faltering even when facing powerful enemies, we are reluctant to allow him to participate in combat. As he becomes more experienced in battle and more proficient in his skills, we find our unease only growing. He is at the age when children are most receptive to knowledge, and no matter what, we do not wish for his classes to take place on the battlefield.",

However, these emotions do not appear to stem solely from his kind nature. At least part of it seems to be because they strongly resonate with some of his past experiences.\nAfter consulting with my superior, I have come to an agreement with the other instructors not to investigate his past, nor to intentionally carry out a psychological intervention. On assessment, we believe that his current state is ideal. When faced with both the good and bad intentions of strangers, he is always able to face them calmly and respond in a positive manner. Moreover, when interacting with his companions, the responsibility he displays and the sense of justice he espouses astonish us all.\n——Excerpt from 'Operator Training Diary'",

Though the children are bound to misbehave, these chatty brats seem cute and well-behaved compared to the troublemakers who came by for their physicals yesterday. Most Infected children have already started to stabilize, with many of them who had lost their mobility gradually recovering.\nAs for the non-Infected children, excessive weight gain has been observed in some of them, which we've assessed to be reasonable, given the fact that many of them suffered from malnutrition while growing up in harsh environments, and proper nutritious intake at Rhodes Island is likely to result in rapid weight gain.\nHowever, Operator Luo Xiaohei's weight gain is somewhat peculiar. First, his diet falls within a reasonable range. His companions, Ah Gen and Xiaobai, have told us that they have never seen him overeat. Second, he gets plenty of exercise: in addition to his regular operations, he also makes a habit of exercising.\nBased on the above two points, we believe that his weight gain requires further observation to rule out any potential pathological factors that may lead to further problems. We recommend scheduling tests starting next week to identify what these factors might be.\n\n[Excerpts from a Medical Department Operator's Private Logs]\nI'm so tired after a long day of work. My neck and back are aching. I just want to go back to the dorm and crash.\nMy goodness, when will I be free from dealing with all these uncooperative patients? And then there's the brats who won't stop running around...\nWhen I first graduated, I was filled with a sense of duty. Now, I just feel dead inside.\nI ran into that black cat again on my way to Medical this morning. It often shows up there, and a lot of my colleagues have seen it. I suppose it enjoys lying there, basking in the sun. Some of the folks who pass by try to play with it, but it basically ignores everyone unless they offer food. Then, it might show some interest.\nDespite its cold demeanor, everyone seems quite enthusiastic about it, and it's even become the topic of conversation.\nOf course, I'm no exception.\nJust watching it engrossed in eating canned food is enough to briefly make me forget the torment of work.\nI always bring some spare snacks and was planning on bringing some more freeze-dried food tomorrow until I saw this morning that everyone in Medical had brought snacks and cat food. After touching bases, we realized that we'd all been separately feeding it over the last few months.\nNo wonder it has put on so much weight... Maybe I should bring some balls of yarn instead tomorrow."
