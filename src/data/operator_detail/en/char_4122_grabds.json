Before she was even as tall as a hoe, she was already imitating the farmers and planting seeds. Unable to bear the sight, the elderly farmers instead sent her to feed the stockbeasts, only to find that they behaved especially well around her, almost as if they were on the same wavelength. As such, she was able to manage the massive ranches there in a very organized and tidy manner.\nGrain Buds has kept herself busy even after coming aboard Rhodes Island as a visitor. She's developed new recipes with the logistics operators at the cafeteria, helped care for the plants at the Convalescent Garden, and naturally never forgets to give every one of the new friends she's made here an easy-to-remember and pleasant-sounding nickname. Many medical operators have noted their work stress greatly decreasing thanks to her being around to look after juvenile patients and comfort them when receiving injections or medicine.\n'Guess it's easier for kids around the same age to hit it off...'\n'Or maybe she thinks she's still taking care of stockbeasts...?'",

That said, none have ever dared to claim to able to speak to animals. Until Grain Buds, that is.\nShe insisted on demonstrating her talents: First, she found a lost storm cloudbeast on the top deck by 'communicating' with another cloudbeast. Next, she used a flute to command a few metal crabs to pick up the food waste scattered about the kitchen (Beanstalk insists that her crabs had always known how to do this). Finally, she even attempted to bring a couple of slumberfeet to help insomnia patients get to sleep, only to fall asleep herself in the hallway instead. From this, we cannot completely rule out the possibility that she does actually have some sort of strange ability.\nAccording to herself, there was this one time when she was five years old that she got lost and went outside the city. The farmers couldn't find her anywhere, and just as everyone was at wit's end, an old stockbeast waded across the river with her sitting on its back. Ever since, she has been very close to stockbeasts, and over time she found she was able to understand the 'words' of all kinds of animals. The stockbeasts would tell her which orchard had the sweetest fruits, the traveling fowlbeasts would tell her that the flowers were in full bloom in the south, etc. When Grain Buds speaks vividly about the colorful land filled with wonder in her childlike tone, she is always able to pique the curiosity of her listeners.\n'How did the stockbeast know the way back?'\n'How wide was the river?'\n'What's a city full of farms like?'\nThe listeners gather around her and bombard her with questions. She seems to have an endless number of amazing stories to tell as well. For example, there was the 'gang war' between stockbeasts, the stockbeast and fowlbeast who befriended each other and ran away together, the fin who swam all across Yan on an adventure... Does it matter if they're true? Just imagining the countryside depicted in her stories is enough to stir one's emotions.",

With her small bamboo flute, she is able to play a variety of distinct melodies, from grand accompaniments pairing with the operas' epic scenes, to melodious tunes to send resting stockbeasts peacefully to sleep. Everyone who has heard her flute has been astonished to see such a seemingly frail girl exert so much energy in one go. She is always happy to use her flute to bring comfort to those around her, and she also loves to, in her own words, 'write' new melodies according to her mood. Her tunes are all uplifting and pleasing to the ear, and He Sheng occasionally writes lyrics to them. The farmers toiling in the fields would always sing along whenever they heard the music. And just like that, the two of them created a number of childlike folk songs that spread throughout Dahuang.\nIn her hazy memories, she once heard her mother playing a reed whistle, but her 'Tianshi duties' took her away from Dahuang before she could teach her daughter how to make one. Later, she learned how to make the whistles herself as well as how to play the bamboo flute. The girl learned to play more and more music, yet her parents never returned. To this day, her melodious flute can still be heard by Dahuang's riverbank, awaiting the return of faraway travelers.\n\n[Classified Log]\n'...Therefore, a Chamber of Heaven's Designs shall be established roughly a hundred <i>li</i> to the north of Dahuang in preparation for the demonic threat.'\n'...Its forces shall consist of those gifted in Originium Arts as selected by each Tianshi Bureau. Those who enter the Chamber of Heaven's Designs, each possessing great skills and a firm resolve, shall train at length and be ready for battle at all times. After a year, only half shall remain. After another year, less than one-tenth shall remain. This shall continue year after year.'\n'The scourge of the demon first and foremost robs one of his mind, and by the time one finds his mind even slightly clouded, it is already too late. Countless have been buried in the north to ensure the survival of their fellows. Relatively few instead live out their years with their minds clouded, rendered incapable of coherent speech for the rest of their lives. Skeletally thin, not even their old acquaintances can recognize them...'\nâ€”Excerpts pertaining to Dahuang, from a history of Yan requiring a very high clearance level",

Such a long-lasting defense of the same area is extraordinarily rare.\nSuch is the place where Grain Buds was born and raised. Having seen all the fields and the men and women working them from a young age, she knows every blade of grass and every tree like the back of her hand; she remembers every crop in every field; she remembers which grasses each kind of stockbeast likes to eat; she remembers how she once fell from a tree and hurt her leg, and He Sheng carried her home on his back across half of Dahuang under the setting sun... The land incorporates the history and memories of the people here, and it becomes part of them. That's how the people and the land are connected.\nWhich is why she too is holding the fort here, watching the crops grow green and then yellow, before they are harvested and new seeds are sown anew. She watches the fields grow larger and larger, as the stockbeasts around her grow bit by bit.

His back is stiff and straight, his legs appear uncomfortable, and he holds tightly onto his Tianshi ruler. Evidently, the girl had dragged him here.\n'Give me your hand. I'll write my name. You just read along!'\nThe man's coarse, thick fingers were pried open by the young girl's small hand to reveal his palm. She stuck out a finger and started writing. The woodcutter thought it was ticklish. He did as the girl said and opened his mouth to laboriously let out some sounds.\n'Grain...'\n'Grainâ€” Buds.'\n'Gra... Grain...

      "desc": "May 10th\nIt feels like I'm going in circles. These so-called 'social activities' keep dragging me back to Dahuang. Not only does the weather not suit me, I can barely understand their accent, and I heard that their pickled vegetables are super super salty! I don't know how I'm going to make it an entire year.\nAs I expected, nothing's gone right since I arrived. I thought I could at least talk to people, but I keep tripping over my own tongue. Not only can nobody understand a word I say, but the stockbeasts keep running away from me!\n\nMay 21st\nI've run into a strange young girl, standing tiptoe atop the backs of the stockbeasts. She jumped around on top of them, and at first glance you'd think she was a fowlbeast that had fallen into the herd. There I was, one leg sunk deep in the mud while my other foot is barely covered, trudging through the muck, when she started laughing at me.\n'Sillyhead!', she said.\nMe...?\n'Take off your shoes!'\nEh?\n'I'll teach you how to walk on top of the stockbeasts so you don't have to go through the mud.'\nI got thrown off the stockbeasts' backs eight times that day, and I'm sure I ate more mud than rice by dinner time. She thumped me across my back, her plumage flapping about as she laughed. Though my luck may be bad, looking at her smiling face makes me feel that there's nothing that can hold me down for long.\n\nJuly 8th\nThat girl was crouching down by the stockbeast pen this time, swaying her head as she played her flute to the herd.\n'Hey, Claypot! Come, quick!'\nWho...?\n'You're new here, right Claypot? I forgot to tell you last time, but my name's Grain Buds!'\nOh, was she talking to me?\n'Do you want to learn how to talk to stockbeasts? I'd say I'm better at it than anyone in all of Yan!'\nShe held my face in one hand, while holding a stockbeast's in the other, and told us to look into each other's eyes. That day might be the first time I realized a stockbeast's bright, intelligent eyes possess the same basic range of emotions as any man. Since then, the stockbeasts really did stop running away from the sound of my voice. I never expected someone like meâ€”who's always getting chased and nipped by tuskbeastsâ€”to suddenly have a group of animal friends.\n\nOctober 4th\nI was out searching for Grain Buds when I ran into her along with another youth who appeared to be a schoolboy. They were playing some odd game where they threw small pieces of bone.\n'Claypot! Come play with us!'\nOh, alright...\n'He's 'Big Buffalo', have you two not met before?'\nI'm afraid not...\n'These were left over from Shu's stew! I don't really know all the rules myself, so you'll have to explain, Big Buffalo!'\nI had no idea that you could turn stockbeast leg bones into toys. A shame I was so clumsy, though. I couldn't catch the bones for quite a long while, and kept accidentally flinging them at their heads instead. Big Buffalo was a nice guy. Didn't talk much, just like me. However, every time he went off to work, he wanted to bring me along. Sometimes Grain Buds would lie down on a stockbeast's back, or hang from a tree. Sometimes she would help us out with work, and other times she would drag us off to play. Out here in the boundless fields, it almost felt like we were a family.\n\nMay 20th\nAs I was leaving Dahuang by car, a group of stockbeasts wandering the fields walked past. Looking at their chubby figures fade into the distance behind us, I suddenly began to feel uneasy, just like I did a year ago when I left home by myself to come to Dahuang. Setting aside not being able to see Dahuang's fields and stockbeasts any longer, would I be able to find friends as good as Grain Buds and Big Buffalo at school? I don't know how I'm going to make it through the next two school years."
