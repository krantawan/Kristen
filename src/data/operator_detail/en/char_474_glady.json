If you haven't seen Gladiia fight... You ain't got no idea what it's like. She sometimes complains about how dry her skin is, how there's no water, how that keeps her outta the game and whatnot. That's cause she runs way faster than arrows. When she fights, she makes all these loud noises, and, like, if she says anything to you during a fight, you'll be dead before you even hear it. Her lance's not for stabbing. She hacks at people with it like an axe, a sickle. It still leaves a whole bloody mess on the ground in the end, but it's creepy for real.\nSeriously, you've never met her before, have you?\n\n—Closure, chilling on the couch as she remarks to a certain eager operator while tossing her portable terminal into the trash can for the third time of the day.",

This isn't anyone's fault.\nHowever, the Ægir must be traitors in their eyes, though that's hard for me to imagine.\nI never got to know my father, but my birth mother was someone who enjoyed authority, indulged in worldly pleasures, and ever so short-sighted—This last part is perhaps arguable, but there is no doubt about the first two.\nThat is why I did not stay with my birth family. It took me a very long time to break free of my birth mother's control too.\nMy family are those who raised, acknowledged, and supported me, and not the ones who merely passed on their genes to me. I am not related to my new family by blood, and that's a common thing among the Ægir.\nKal'tsit thinks the Ægir's pride and isolation are sins in themselves.

She's on the technology side, so she's not too familiar with theories and the like.\nÆgir's basic education is really on another level. From my point of view, she's an all-rounder. Are consuls supervisors, though? Do scientists and engineers run the country too? Hm... It's quite hard to imagine, really.\nBy the way, military technologies are apparently technologies too.\nOriginium Arts don't count, however. She doesn't understand that at all. Are all Abyssal Hunters, like, completely insulated from Originium? Even someone with as bad of an infection as Specter couldn't use the most simple of Arts.\nI think I kind of have a guess why that is, though she'll never admit to it.\nI think the Abyssal Hunters have to be the product of Ægir's technological research. God knows how Ægir gets its people to accept that kind of research, though..\nÆgir's technological level is really beyond measure. Its cities are completely invisible even under such immense pressure, its energy facilities are powered without the use of minerals, and its low-temperature alloy treatment process... the ability to transmit large amounts of information with minimal loss, and the blends of so many different species.\nDear god.\nWhat's more, the ocean... If the lands are truly boundless, then what about the ocean? How many Ægir cities are there? There can't be more cities down there than on land, can there?\n[Why haven't they tried to make contact with us?]\n\nNow that's the million-dollar question.

No one knows what has become of Ægir beneath the ocean's surface, much less whether the other Abyssal Hunters are still alive.\n\nI am certain that the Ægirs that the Iberians took in, the 'Islanders,' that is, were citizens of the sea who left their homeland after the events that unfolded there.\nMost of the islanders are technological workers, with only a small amount of them scientific researchers. The science consuls? Leaving their magnificent, advanced homes behind was sacrilegious to them.\nThough they were mere fragments of Ægir's technological advances, using the Islanders' technology, the Iberians immediately propelled themselves from just another powerful nation into a dominating superpower... The whole of Ægir's might and technological prowess are things that the nations on land will never want to witness firsthand.\nAnd that's to say nothing of how the majority of those who live on land do not know that oceans existed in the first place.\nAlthough Gladiia remains unwilling to reveal this information, we know that the few Ægirs there are in Iberia had moved there years ago, and that's also how the Abyssal Hunters came to be. From this, we can already surmise that the events that transpired in Ægir are no mere disasters.\nThe Abyssal Hunters are undoubtedly the tip of the iceberg when it comes to Ægir's military technologies. They definitely are not Ægir's last defense. They are its vanguards and its sacrifices, as though the Ægirs were trying to test the sea monsters.\nGladiia is not one to shy away from conveying her pride using etiquettes, but she cannot hide the fact that she is also trying to conceal her anxiety.\nI can tell they have much to keep from me, and far too much. \nShe hasn't told you why the Seaborn was looking for Skadi, has she?\nSpeaking of which, the Seaborns are far from the top of the hierarchy of those sea monsters. There must be even more advanced life deep under the sea.\nGladiia tried to protect the Abyssal Hunters in her own way. She's afraid that the Church of the Deep and the Seaborns are far from the only ones who will try to do harm to the Abyssal Hunters. She believes the technology and information she holds are one of the few bargaining chips she still has left.\nShe is trying to trust us, but she remains untrustful of others. If she didn't want to help all of us fend off these threats from the sea, then she would be sunbathing on the deck right about now instead of running all around the world.\nIn addition, if an uncontrollable change is occurring to Skadi, then as one of the first Abyssal Hunters, the road Gladiia has ahead of her is just as bumpy.\nGive her a little time. The training and experience she has will lead her to make the right conclusion.\nShe is still a citizen of Ægir, but we... we don't belong to any nation out there.\nÆgir is yet silent.\n\n—Kal'tsit.",

      "desc": "Upon hearing her mother leave the house, young Gladiia gets up from her bed, calls her lamp alight, and pulls out her vanity handmirror from under her pillow. Not that she would with any regularity be fully awake when the clock rolls over to zero, but tonight, she needs to look at herself. She needs to choose. As other Ægir view her, she is Gladiia, daughter of key Academy of Sciences personnel, winner of all youth competitions, a family girl, a young success story. But in her mirror, Gladiia sees a carbon-based robot, an emotionless form. Her memory begins with her birth mother being infatuated with Ægir affairs and Academy policymaking, her home merely a secondary point of residence, after the Academy's lounge. She once believed her birth mother sought accomplishment from her, and so she compelled herself to relentlessly reach new heights, applying the standards of adults to her young self. But she never was able to pry any form of feedback from her birth mother—no acknowledgement, no criticism, nothing whatsoever. No, her birth mother gave all her time to Ægir, and left not one idle second of one spare minute for her daughter.\nPerhaps it was all an accident that she was raised, and this household had no reason to exist. This was the sort of conclusion Gladiia reached.\nSo, what else but to look for somewhere she can truly call 'home,' Ægir she can truly call 'family.'\nShe has decided. She will seek. She is set to do it.\nShe wants to hear for herself just what kind of case her birth mother might make in a civil court of law.\nGladiia stows away the handmirror, turns off her light, and sinks into rest.\nHer mind swims frantically with planning.\nShe is restless all night.\n......\nGladiia stands before the tremendous standing mirror of the Consul's residence, examining her negligible self in the looking glass. In just a few hours, she will depart the mansion, take to an operating table, and begin the Abyssal Hunter modification surgery. Perhaps, the moment the procedure is over, her dutiful vocation will be as a military commander and not a Technology Consul, and she will take to the battlefield, there becoming a monster with hands drenched in fresh blood. This has completely destroyed any notion of plotting her life's trajectory, and may even end her time then and there. Gladiia has never feared death, nor the giving of her life, but the sumptuous hall she sees in the mirror does make clear to her an aside—she is still teeming with regrets. Some are desires, some are responsibilities, some are promises, and becoming an Abyssal Hunter will render them all forever unfulfilled. If only the surgery could be postponed long enough, if only Ægir could publish the full scope of the plans to her as soon as possible... This is the first time she realizes that she had never had it all firmly in her grasp like she thought. She will lose, and she will never be able to regain.\nGladiia looks around the hall one more time, then returns to her study.\nIn a few hours, she will depart for the Abyssal Hunter experimentation site. Before she does, she has the mansion's smart housekeeping system store two documents.\nOne, her speech to be given upon becoming an Abyssal Hunter.\nOne, a will.\n......\nAfter Gladiia is marooned in a land not of Ægir, she has in the truest sense of the words lost it all. All she has left with her are a bloodridden lance, a still-passable outfit, and a desiccated and scorching eternity. And now, she stands before a pothole filled with fresh water, gazing upon her own reflection, washing the filth and bloodstains from her clothes.\nThe silt comes off with the water easily enough, but the clots of blood on her garments refuse to be washed off. With no option but to brush them by hand, she watches as their hardened forms attain a pellucidity, turn the shade of liquid blood, and run through the seams, dripping to a rest upon the soil. Is it her blood? The Seaborn's blood? Or her fellows' blood? She cannot differentiate. All of a sudden, Gladiia notices something, and she leans close to the hole, carefully examining her neck.\nA tiny scale.\nThough why is a mystery, Gladiia's birth mother comes to her mind in that moment. If she could, she would rather suffer her neglect again. This scale would never have found the chance to rest upon her neck.\nBut it has.\nGladiia stands up, and throws her freshwater-soaked hair behind her in one gesture.\nShe can indeed feel it. There is an embitterment, a discontent inside her. There is no need for these feelings to surface, and they do nothing to help in this present situation.\nShe has indeed lost it all, but she finds she can still afford to uphold her basic honor and dignity, which in turn means she can still move onwards with her head held high.\nShe needs no hope. She simply focuses on possibilities, feasibilities, and results.\nShe can still return to Ægir.\nShe is still alive to recover the Abyssal Hunters, scattered and lost.\nAs long as the probability is not zero, she is still bound to try.\nSo make good on it she shall.\nGladiia wipes her lance's bloodstains dry, and vanishes from the side of the 'hole.'\nSeconds later, the sonic boom jolts the water from the pool, blanketing any and all trace she was ever there.",

Many of these researchers are elites she hand-picked from the Academy of Technology—capable, experienced, and loyal to both the Ægir people and every dome under the tides. Now, these elites look back at their Consul through the mirror, made from the same material as the domes, and purse their lips. Since asking her the question, none have spoken; some even turn away from the gaze of their Consul.\nAs a Consul, social rationality is usually the only philosophical instrument Gladiia needs to analyze the behaviors of others. Born in the sea, the Ægir never display meaningless behavior, so at this moment, she is particularly curious about the silence of her fellow people. Is it reverence, fear, or sadness? Or perhaps it is guilt and relief all at once, that the person who has to sacrifice their body to merge with the Sea Born and save all of Ægir is not them?\nShe knows she will not get the answer now, and will have no need for it once the surgery is complete.\nShe remembers when the Academy of Science attempted to develop a batch of artificial organisms injected with Sea Born neuro-cells. These organisms were intended to mimic Sea Born activities in a controlled environment, aiding the Ægir in understanding those abominations. To achieve this, they had to be both loyal servants of the Ægir and establish a limited connection with the Sea Born and their clan.\nShe recalls that the project, which initially made huge progress, ended in tragedy. As cell integration reached a critical point, the organisms were quickly assimilated by the Sea Born and devoured the entire research team. The Sea Patrol had no choice but to call off the rescue and obliterate the entire research facility from the sea bed with their battleship.\nShe also remembers her mother, Horatia, being a staunch supporter of that radical project. They had even debated over it. Now, Gladiia herself is about to partake in an even more radical experiment, with several failed attempts and dead subjects before her already.\nThe first Hunter of Ægir once said that the Abyssal Hunters would not repeat the failure of the artificial organisms because they are not slaves, but warriors who command the tides.\nThe abyss may claim my body, but I still belong to Ægir.\n'Scissors.' The Consul's order is curt. Little Handy extends its other limb, and thin blades protrude from its end.\nShe holds out a lock of light golden hair and lets the blades close around it. When the surgery is complete, the blood of the Sea Born will change the color of her hair.\n'Store this for me. I will claim it back after the surgery.'",
