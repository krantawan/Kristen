Using Originium for too long tires her out. After discussion with the tech staff, it was decided Ch'en lacked the necessary conduit to control her Originium power. Without one, Ch'en could never master it. \n\nI saw her test results. The thinner the staff, the better she is at assimilation. But what's the point? Maybe if you had something shaped like a sword, it might work for her. But who would want to use it for that? A sword is for slashing! We're going to need a lot more work on this.. \n--Caster D",

After returning to Lungmen, she almost immediately joined the Guard Department. \nNo one knows anything about her life prior to enrolling in the L.G.D. School, and no one questions her ability, dedication, or hatred of her enemies. Police officers working with Ch'en often complained about her demeanor--too strict and too harsh. Everyone thought that this harsh character would disappear in the struggle for power, and she would soften up after being worn down by endless incidents. \nSurprisingly, both crime and casualty rates have declined in the past two years, and the younger generation of officers began being promoted faster and more substantively. Ch'en was promoted and joined one of the most important teams in the Department, the Special Inspection Unit. \nMembers of this unit are generally not allowed to serve more than two years - to protect their lives and reduce their stress. Perhaps this position isn't suitable to serve for a long time: old inspectors' careers always seem to end with heroic sacrifice. \nCh'en did not retreat. She doesn't even know how to back down. \nShe became the fastest promoted officer in the history of the Lungmen police force, and also the youngest Special Inspector in the Department. Those who ridiculed her were impressed by her perseverance. After all, planning for the future is one thing. Planning every day is another. \nWhy was she so hard? Why live life this way? No one can could understand. \nThere are often small pieces of paper that have been ripped apart or angrily crumbled in Ch'en's trash bin.",

People naturally ask her, \n'Are you stressed?' \n'No reason to be.' \nNo one has ever gotten a different answer out of her. \nCh'en lives this way every day, always doing what she can for Lungmen and honing her skills.

      "desc": "The scars on the earth came blitzing in from the horizon, striking true at the Victorian-style complex. The buildings are like a forest torn apart by a whirlwind, collapsed in a radius surrounding a singular point. In these ruins of the Empire, two figures turn over a toppled stele, attempting to find higher ground.\n'How long has this place been empty?' Ch'en stands atop the rubble and looks into the distance. The names on the stele behind her once stood for glory, now all but worn away.\nBagpipe's voice comes from somewhere below. 'This school buildin's been abandoned since the war broke out. All the students who didn't complete their course yet got sent off to new campuses, finished the rest out there... Chenchen, that's our old trainin' grounds up in front. You remember?'\n'Especially well. I feel like my time as a student was defined by missing out on things. The moment I graduated, they finished repairing the roads, <i>and</i> the training grounds.'\nThe training grounds have been blown by the shockwave into a plate of jagged protrusions. Ch'en picks up a stone, flings it into a shrub sticking out of a crack in the plate, and a fowlbeast hiding within flies off for somewhere far away, screeching and cawing all the while.\n'Things were good enough as is, back then.' Bagpipe's voice comes in close as she stops and stands by Ch'en's ear.\n'True. It was probably the simplest time of my life. I didn't have all these issues weighing on my mind, I just had to focus purely on training and studying.'\n'That's what drove you? You trained like a maniac every day, got As on every standard subject and all.' Bagpipe clasps her hands on Ch'en's shoulders, and gently rocks back and forth.\n'After I returned, I realized just how many things couldn't be solved with swords. There were times I felt far too insignificant, and that even though I worked hard, I couldn't change all that much—sometimes, taking out the enemy doesn't do a thing to address the problem.' Ch'en shakes her head, as if trying to throw her tangled mess of feelings about the past straight out of her brain.\nThe two of them head up a steep slope. The flowerbed is still where they remember it.\nHalf of the logo of the once-eminent Royal Guard Academy is submerged in the mud, the other half resting against a fractured stone pillar. Sunset spills across, the light pouring over the symbol now mottled with rust, and what remaining metallic shine there is speaks to the place's former glory.\n'It's all changed. Victoria's changed too, hasn't it?' Ch'en mumbles to herself, staring at the crest.\n'Some people haven't changed. I went to go visit Instructor Tyrell a few days ago 'cause I knew you were comin'. You were gone in such a hurry back then, you just left all your papers and stuff in the dorms—she's been keepin' them safe all these years. All this is proof of you passin' your studies. Oh, aye, and this too!'\nBagpipe fishes out a stack of documents from her bag, as well as a wooden sword.\n'Here's the trainin' sword you used back then. Was meant to go back, technically speakin', but you did so smashin' the instructors were goin' to give you it, y'know, as a surprise for you...'\n'Give her my thanks. I left too quickly...'\n'At least you've come back now. So many of our year never have, even after all this time.'\nThe two fall silent.\n'Where do you think you'll be in ten years?'\n'Who knows? We should be heading back soon. There's still a lot to do.' Ch'en gazes into the distance, off in the direction of Lungmen. 'They arranged everything for me, whether it was going to this school or leaving it. Now, I'm going to go back by myself.'"
