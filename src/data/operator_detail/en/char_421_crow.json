The stark contrast between this side of her and her normal demeanor has left a deep impression upon many a squad leader who had taken her on a mission.",

Due to her mother's early death and the lax discipline of the True Bolívarians, she followed her father and grew up in the military. Because of her docile and charming personality, many of the soldiers saw her as their shining jewel.\nThe True Bolívarans is an independent government established by the locals to resist the coalition government and the Singas government. From Dobermann's perspective, their army is extremely rugged, but lacks clear organization and discipline. La Pluma grew up in this environment that emphasized the values of loyalty and rapport, and setting aside the big picture, she should've been quite happy - if not for the battle that claimed the lives of her father as well as three thousand other soldiers.\nIn regards to the specific details surrounding that battle, Pancho did not want to mention any more about it to La Pluma and Tequila, as they were not firsthand witnesses. Furthermore, Dobermann was still a part of the coalition government at the time. The three concurrent governments of Bolívar were not unified in their intelligence and they all regulated the relevant information as it could easily be used to discredit them. Therefore, it is difficult for us to collect accurate information. From the accounts of two individuals in tandem with the intelligence gathered by Tequila, we suspect that this episode was carried out to persecute Pancho, one of the heads of the True Bolívarians's hawkish faction at the time, and this persecution cost the lives of three thousand innocent soldiers.",

            "storyText": "We were surprised that someone as young as La Pluma would enlist in such a plan when she has virtually no knowledge of Bolívar's domestic affairs. This inevitably reflects poorly upon Tequila as well as her surrogate father, Pancho.\nOf course, this is hardly true in reality.\nFrom the beginning, both Tequila and Pancho believed that La Pluma should be kept away from the conflict, so at least after they came to Dossoles, they chose to conduct their activities without La Pluma. However, as the three of them were still family, La Pluma would eventually discover all of these activities.\nAccording to La Pluma's own account, she gave them the cold shoulder for two weeks until they agreed to let her join. According to Tequila, this outcome was the result of his deliberation, followed by days of pleading Pancho.\nAfter all, as La Pluma's sworn brother, he knew that although his sister was obedient, her obedience was built on what she perceived as a mutually trusting relationship. She is willing to obey the words of those she relies on, but at the same time, she is unwilling to accept being excluded even if the other party was acting out of good intentions; even moreso if they were acting on good intentions, she would reject that even more. For her, sharing both happiness and hardship are most important than anything else, a mindset that may also be related to her childhood and her experiences becoming Pancho's adopted daughter.\nOf course, since she chose to join the plan, we can't ignore her status as a rebel against the Dossoles City government. Setting aside the fact that ignorance is no justification for her actions, if she simply sees her family ties as the sole criteria for the actions she takes, then she is perhaps even more terrifying than Tequila, who has full knowledge of what he is doing.\nLa Pluma is aware of this, and though she is kind-hearted, she has even stronger convictions in her views of Pancho's actions than Tequila. As a youth who grew up amidst the flames of war, she has not seen fewer wars than Tequila, and her views of war may not even necessarily be shallower than his. In fact, even Dobermann said that the youth of Bolívar notwithstanding, even she did not know how to stop war except with more war, until she left Bolívar.\nFor a young woman like La Pluma, the way Pancho did things was perfectly normal. Rather, we should see Tequila's ideology, which has become shaky as a result of Candela's influence, as an outlier.\nRhodes Island has no right or authority to weigh in on the political situation of Bolívar, nor does it intend to judge whether Candela or Pancho is correct. We can only learn what is truly happening in that land from the people of Bolívar.\nPerhaps nobody can cast that judgment, and only time will provide an answer.",

At these times, Pancho will pat her head while slowly explaining that she may not yet understand these things. She is willing to listen nevertheless, and these moments have become some of her most treasured.\nFurthermore, in conversations with the Doctor, La Pluma has mentioned more than once Pancho's disappointment as well as pride in both Tequila and himself.\nHe is disappointed that as his son continues to work under Mayor Candela, his ideals inevitably become tainted, and he can see his son wavering.\nHowever, he is proud that his son has undoubtedly matured and is doing well in all aspects, and feels happy from the bottom of his heart when others mention how his son is doing.\nHe even said that he actually hoped for Tequila and La Pluma to leave Dossoles before he began his plan, so that no matter what happened to Dossoles, his two children would have nothing to do with it.\nOf course, he may have never said these words to Tequila, or Tequila might have not taken such words seriously. Such is the nature of the father-and-son relationship. Inadvertently, they've become strangers who know each other better than anyone else.\nOriginally, La Pluma didn't plan to leave Dossoles with Tequila, wanting to stay behind to look after Pancho. Only when Pancho told her to leave did she decide to go with Tequila, though the relationship between the two siblings has become strained as a result of Pancho's affairs.\nThere's not much we can do about this, since family affairs tend to be complicated and peoples' rationales can be convoluted. However, her closeness with the Doctor may yet be a good first step. After all, since we accepted her as one of her own here at Rhodes Island, she also hopes to find a new life as well as her own path.",

After all, people who want someone to talk to often aren't looking for answer, but sometimes just want to listen to themselves.\nAll of this has gradually made La Pluma more popular with the aficionados and drunkards among operators.

      "desc": "Why do people like to drink?\nWhen Rafaela first began her bartending job, the question floated to her mind from time to time.\nShe can always ask her papá when she has a question. But this is a work thing—Papá usually barely talks to her about his work, so likewise, she'd better not ask him about hers.\nAnd she doesn't want to ask her hermano about it.\nEspecially not her hermano.\nSo she'll ask a customer! People are always coming and going in Dossoles, but in just a short time, Rafaela's learned to recognize a lot of regulars, and they all like to talk to her.\nAccording to the person dancing wildly to the jota while calling her 'Rafa' and 'chica' at the top of their lungs, you drink for the color, the mouthfeel, the taste, and for a moment of joy.\nBut according to the person calling her 'Señorita Silva' while leaning on the bar counter, sluggishly lifting a hand as they sing fado, you drink just to forget and be free from your worries for a while.\n'Thanks for asking,' they add more often than not.\nRafaela isn't sure if she comprehended all these answers, but she makes sure to remember every one. It's how it should be, she thinks.\nTimes change.\nAs the landship sails, there's a regular thrumming all throughout the hold. Rafaela hasn't gotten used to this noise yet—after all, it's nothing like fowlbeast chirps or beating waves—but she doesn't react badly to it at all.\nShe's asked another operator before, and now she knows this is how it should be on the ship.\nIn the landship, music is more varied too, with lots she's never heard before.\nEven so, the person who dances wildly while calling her 'Rafa' and 'chica' at the top of their lungs is still there. When she meets this kind of person, she does as they request, and squeezes some of the sweetest fruit juice into their drinks, adding some of the most bracing syrup. But at the same time, she secretly dilutes these flavors until they make for the coolest, most reinvigorating flavors. She gives whoever's drinking it a moment of joy, and all the wake-up they need to bask in that joy.\nAnd there's still the person who calls her 'Señorita Silva' and 'Miss La Pluma' while leaning on the bar counter, sluggishly lifting a hand. When she meets this kind of person, she does as they quietly ask her, and pulls the strongest, most biting bottles from the racks to pour into their glass. But at the same time, she doesn't forget to mix in a little of the finest pedigree, sourced locally from Logroño. She watches them down a glass of bitter drink, but knows the taste left behind won't be totally astringent.\n'Thank you,' they say in approval more often than not. Sometimes she nods, but feels strange about it, so other times she just doesn't nod at all.\nOf course, this method of mixology isn't entirely described in the Dossoles Guide to Cocktails, but she makes a note of it in there herself.\nAnd she's already given the book away to someone who deserves it. She may not have it anymore, but she's learned it by heart.\nRafaela feels that this way is good.\nThis is how it should be.",
