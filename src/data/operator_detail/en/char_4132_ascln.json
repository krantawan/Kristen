You would then be rather disappointed to learn that you spent all that effort just to find the file of a completely unremarkable operator. Disposition: normal. Abilities: average. Performance: so-so. Even the attached photo is painfully ordinary. It was clearly taken at a roadside self-service camera booth at the affordable price of ten LMD for eight copies.\nBut if you were to follow a series of nigh-imperceptible yet oddly specific instructions, and bypass a series of convoluted corridors designed to make your head spin, you would find yourself at the S.W.E.E.P. office. You would then realize that she is not ordinary in the slightest.\nEverything 'normal' about Ascalon is a deliberate construction. She conceals all trace of herself in order to fall beneath anybody's notice. On occasion, her habit of removing herself from existence will also affect her private life. If you ever have the opportunity to go shopping with her, do not be alarmed when the clerk walks past her to hand you your purchase. Simply take your things and go. The clerk was merely unable to perceive her.\nThis is a skill of hers. If she is ever unexpectedly seen, she is able to erase herself from their perception. As our colleague Projekt Red once said during a rather frank evaluation of her, even standing by her side, she couldn't detect a hint of scent. Note that Projekt Red's nose is extremely sensitive, and she can normally get all the information she needs about a person from their scent.\nAscalon makes a habit of having no habits. During conservation, she will use a different voice each time she talks to someone. Her movements are efficient and without superfluous motions. Everything she does is determined by how the majority of the crowd around her is behaving. Whatever they do, she does too, all to ensure she will be forgotten. After all, nobody would pay attention to someone who never stands out.\nYou might be curious as to how we acquired the above information, considering her secretive nature.\nS.W.E.E.P. has a special form of training: to hone their reconnaissance and counter-reconnaissance skills, their members must both track Ascalon and avoid being detected by her for a week, all while gathering as much information on her as they can. Regretfully, none have managed to last the entire week as of yet. The above is all the intel they have thus far managed to discern.\nThe previous record holder was Ines. She tailed Ascalon for an entire morning, and managed to uncover her proclivity for high thread-count cotton clothing before her cover was blown. However, Hoederer was the one to write the report for Ines, and his fondness for rhetorical devices diminishes its usefulness.\nThe current record holder is Projekt Red. While she did not discover any valuable intel, she did manage to successfully stuff some tail lint into Ascalon's pocket without being noticed. It is rather difficult to imagine how she managed this feat. I suspect she has learned a lot from Ascalon herself.\n—An excerpt from a note pertaining to S.W.E.E.P.'s 'manager,' strictly prohibited from being removed from their office\nIt won't happen again. It took me half an hour to get all that fur out.\n—Ascalon's response, penned at the end of the note",

            "storyText": "[Voice Log]\nI saw your message, Doctor. I must say, you've been rather curious about her ever since your experiences in Londinium, yet you've never come to ask me directly.\nIn the earliest days of Rhodes Island's establishment, nearly every day saw a new assassination attempt on Kal'tsit and Amiya. As the one in charge of S.W.E.E.P., Ascalon has protected Rhodes Island from the shadows from the beginning.\nShe is a master of close-quarters combat, personally trained by the Regent himself. Her two sleeve blades? Those are her last resorts. She will happily wield whatever is at hand first. Did you know she can kill a man with a bowl of soup barely three centimeters deep? Simply ridiculous.\nIn short, whatever you can imagine, she can do, along with everything you can't. I suggest not knowing too many of the details. You are a commander, after all, and it would be a pity to have your precious sleep taken over by nightmares. Oh, right, as for her Arts, I've only ever glimpsed them once. Most who <i>have</i> are too dead to discuss them. Perhaps you should ask Kal'tsit. She would know more.\n—■■■\n\nForgive me, Doctor, but there is nothing I can divulge on this topic.\nAs the head of Medical, all I can inform you of is that the harm her Originium Arts place on her far exceeds that of your average Infected operator. Since returning from Londinium, it is our unanimous belief that she should stay completely off the frontlines. Whatever your plans for her Arts may be, I suggest you reconsider them.\n—Kal'tsit\n\nI've heard from Kal'tsit that you've been asking about my Arts. It seems you're as inquisitive as ever.\nYou could have just asked me directly. I have nothing to hide from you: I am the mist, and it is my blade. Simple to conceal, yet able to strike decisively at critical moments.\nThat is all, nothing more.\n—Ascalon\n\nAlright, now you're asking too many questions. One at a time, please.\nFirst, Kal'tsit is right. My Arts harm me whenever I use them. On some missions, a little blurring of my outline is enough. For others, I must disappear completely into the mist.\nNo, it is not a smokescreen. The mist is my eyes. It misses nothing. The mist takes away life. Both mine and my enemies'. To this day, very few have lived to tell the tale.\nNobody taught me to do this. My Arts manifested while I was out hunting.\nWild animals have far sharper intuition than humans. I hid to avoid being sensed, and there is no better hiding spot than the air itself. It's also thanks to these Arts that I can survive Catastrophes.\nAfter I first came to Kazdel, Master... Theresis taught me a lot. I put them to use, both on and off the battlefield, as well as in places far darker.\nIn Babel, I had even more opportunities to refine my mastery. At the time, manpower was in short supply, and on some missions, they turned out to have other, more personal uses.\nOh, you've already written another question.\n...\n...\nYes. It hurts. It hurts every time I use them.\n—Ascalon",

Of the participants in the operation against her, only one survived.\nIntelligence confirms that Babel has left the Kazdel region and is heading south towards Rim Billiton. The target is not within Babel's zone of control, and leads a small group of stranded survivors. She is isolated and helpless, and this is our best opportunity to kill her. Note that if the target goes out of control, it will be difficult to predict her actions. We request that the Regent and the General re-evaluate her threat level.\n—Intel intercepted from a Military Commission contact point, Jan 15th 1095\n\nIn the wake of Theresa's death, Ascalon underwent a self-imposed exile. Before Kal'tsit recalled her, she undertook an unbroken series of assassinations and infiltrations. The intel sent back was rather sparse, and only directly related to the mission at hand. Not a single word was spared for herself.\nAll that we obtained were the names of the targets she had erased, trickling in one by one. At times, we had to rely on scraps of intercepted Military Commission and Victorian intel to speculate on her current circumstances. She has placed herself in great danger. As for her psychological condition... we cannot say.\nShe has almost completely relied solely on her own strength to purge the traitors to Babel who participated in Theresa's assassination. It is as though she believes that if she purges them, she will make up for the mistakes she made then. But our understanding is that, as far as she is concerned, every kill she makes only gives her cause to think over past events once more, which only pushes her deeper into her inner turmoil.\nAfter some internal disagreement within Babel, Ascalon was determined to be the sole candidate to establish the path forward for Rhodes Island to follow. However, this is no reason to ignore her fall into turmoil. With Rhodes Island safe for the time being, and all threats to Amiya eliminated, there were many new things lying ahead on our path. There was no reason for us to leave Ascalon behind in the past, even if... that was her request.\n\n[Voice Log]\nI plan to recall Ascalon. We cannot leave her trapped in the past. Rhodes Island has only just been established, and we have plenty of work requiring her attention. I hope that this work can help her find a goal, faith in something, or perhaps even... a measure of regularity in her life.\nThough Theresa and I never wished for her to become a weapon, in war she has become what we least wished to see.\nBut even a weapon should have worth beyond its wielding.\n—A message from Kal'tsit to ■■■, ■■■ 22nd 109■",

At first, I wanted to keep you under observation to verify my suspicions, all for the sake of avenging Theresa. But that's not why S.W.E.E.P. was established. If you take the time to listen to meeting recordings from back then, you'll find that S.W.E.E.P. exists merely to help Rhodes Island follow the course Theresa envisioned.\nYour behavior since our return from Londinium has made it clear that you are prepared to lead Rhodes Island forward again.\nI'll remind you, Doctor: You don't need to torture yourself over your past. All you'll get are the same questions thrown back at you, over and over. We don't need someone else stuck in the past. Once you've forged far enough ahead, that is when we shall part.

The blade slides along its tracks out into the fierce sunlight, pinpricks of light dripping down its edge until coming together like molten iron silently filling a mold.\nIn the heat, there is only quiet.\nThis quiet is broken by the hissing of carrion fowlbeasts. Under the scorching sun, an elderly Sarkaz lifts his head, and sees mist careening down the sides of the canyon towards him. The burdenbeast disappears, as does the canyon. The faintest shadow crosses his eyes, another layer of gray atop the ones from gazing at the forge year round.\nThe blade leaves his chest soon after. His skewered torso fills with blood, leaving him to drown on dry land. He remembers that this slow death was but one of many cruel punishments used in Kazdel. At first, he thinks he will spend his final moments lying flat on the hot sands, his puzzled burdenbeast his only deathbed companion. However,  the deathmonger hasn't left yet. She kneels down on one knee, supporting his back.\n'Oh... it's you.'\nThe wrinkles on his face gradually smoothen. He still remembers those eyes. Back then, he had looked up from the forge to see a girl by the general's side. She was young, but had a warrior's eyes, and hands that could tear apart a storm. Then the general told him to make her a sword.\n'Can I see it one last time?' She observes the old man's longing gaze. 'I... didn't see it clearly just now.'\nThe deathmonger looks towards her wrist. She remembers those willing to die for their cause. The armories of the Military Commission offered excellent equipment, but... She places her hand on the old man's chest. The death-defying fighters were prepared. Kazdel's finest smith had personally forged their regicidal blades.\nHer finger curls, lightly touching the base of her palm. The blade slides along its tracks out into the fierce sunlight, pinpricks of light dripping up its edge until coming together. The old man strokes these points of light. He knows their true identity. Every parry, every strike, leaves a scar upon its edge. Some of the scars are stained with his blood.\n'As I forged it... the fires told me that one day, it would take my life. But... it was a commission from the general.' The old man raises his torso, struggling to breathe as he lifts his head to look into his deathmonger's eyes.\n'How about you? Shadow beneath the sun. Who commissioned you... to settle this account?'\nThe deathmonger does not answer. She covers his eyes with her palm, allowing her sleeve-blade to cut across his throat. The carrion fowlbeasts whirl down from above the canyon, crowding into the shadows of the cliff and rubbing their beaks against one another's feathers.",
