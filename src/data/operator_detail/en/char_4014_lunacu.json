The rap star himself somehow showed up at HR and handed over Lunacub's file, along with his autograph. As he put it: 'This kid did a little something for my girls, so you guys take care of her.'\nLunacub herself didn't hesitate to take Rhodes Island's offer, to the point that I'm not quite sure she knows what a 'job' really is. But when we got to talking about company benefits, she immediately showed some enthusiasm. And she had somehow already figured out where the cafeteria was on the landship, which we can say was a good demonstration of her intelligence gathering abilities.\nWe didn't have high hopes for her operator exams since, as far as we knew, she'd never received any formal training. But she completed the entire battery with impressive skill, and proudly told the instructors, 'Out there, I learned to use my brain to help the pack solve problems! Agnese always says I'm really smart!'\nI don't know who Agnese is, but when it comes to sneaking into the warehouse, Lunacub is plenty smart.

Or to be more precise, she was raised by the wilderness.\nShe reports living in the wilds with the beasts for as long as she can remember, with her friend Agnese teaching her how to feed herself, how to use a bow and arrow, and how to work with the beasts to lay traps and catch prey. Our investigations reveal that Lunacub did lead a pack that included several types of beast, which is indeed puzzling, as it is rare enough for different beasts to coexist peacefully in a pack, let alone submit to the authority of a human.\nSome Rhodes Island researchers suspect her of using some kind of Arts to manipulate them, but she herself denies this. 'If you spend a lot of time with them, you start to understand what they want. They're not complicated.' But observation records suggest that 'getting along' is definitely not as simple as she makes it out to be.\nLunacub often mentions a friend 'Agnese,' who played a very important role in her relationship with the pack. Discussions with her make it clear that Agnese is more of a parental figure than a friend. She consistently claims that Agnese is with her, and there are indeed indications that some kind of presence surrounds Lunacub. But whatever the case may be, we have yet to determine who or what this 'Agnese' is.\n[Classified Log]\nI spoke to Agnese and we agreed.\nIt may still be risky to have Projekt Red and Lunacub in the same space, but we have to try. I will do what I can to make sure that Red is stable and that Lunacub is restrained by Agnese's request.\nI know that Red went to Siracusa, I know what she did, and this pointless conflict has gone on long enough.",

I hope that's the right way to address you; it's what everyone else calls you, anyway. You're a clever one, and you're different from most of the others I've met. Your nature is fundamentally different, and I think maybe you can answer my question.\nCreatures are often trapped by their nature, both yours and ours. This impulse is sometimes articulated as desire, but in my opinion, this is much more primitive than desire. Desire should at least come from the heart, not from raw, subconscious tendencies. What's even sillier is how some think themselves unblinded by it, claiming that the cravings in their flesh and bones are their own. They take pride and pleasure in it. Yes, I'm talking about Zaaro, the pitiful man.\nBut I grew bored, and tired. My friends laughed at Emperor, saying he should be belly-sliding across the tundra, as that was his purpose. Just as our purpose is to produce the packmaster of all wolves, and then produce another after a long enough time, and then another after that.\nI found Lunacub and raised her. By all rights, she should be my Fang, one who breaks the other Fangs. But the Fangs of a beast don't smile or stare at you with two big eyes and ask you adorably stupid questions. It feels good to be a friend, much nicer than being a master.\nI tried to get Lunacub to break free of the path laid for her, but you have to understand that inertia is much more powerful than we ever know. It's like the one you call 'Projekt Red.' You tried hard to influence her, but she struggled to break free. It was the only way she knew how to live. She went back to Siracusa, and your doctor tells me she will return, hopefully.\nMy desire to find a new life for Lunacub also means that I have to resist the impulses of my nature. But if Emperor can do it, there's no reason I should be less than him.\nMaybe you can help us, maybe you know the way. Show me, show me how to shed your instincts, and how to throw off your destiny, 'Doctor.'",

Lunacub has her own dormitory (even if she's not often indoors), and camping on the deck violates Rhodes Island safety and firefighting regulations, but still she assiduously avoids patrols, setting up her tent on the deck again and again, always somewhere where she can get a clear view of the sky.\nThe tent was built by Lunacub herself, although 'built' might not be the best word: it moreso resembles fabric pieced together into one, then propped up as best she can so the wasteland gales don't blow it down so easily. What's noteworthy is where the fabric originates—\nFollowing Lunacub's eleventh time this quarter attempting to sneak into the warehouse and tripping the security system, Rhodes Island HR had a thorough conversation with her, and found in her possession several unregistered Rhodes Island uniforms (parts of which were shorn off and sewn into her tent). Lunacub's manners were impeccable during the conversation, expressing that she was 'just passing by,' and that 'on the outside, you can take stuff if nobody's watching it.' HR rectified the lapse in Lunacub's understanding, reiterated Rhodes Island discipline, as well as inquired as to where certain other parts of the tent fabric had come from.\n'The grey cloth? I found it in the forest. It was hanging on a tree. I pulled it down.'\n'This one's really warm, so it's really useful when it snows. I found it too, buried in a hole. Agnese told me about it.'\n'This one's amazing, it stops water! Someone gave it to me. I know what that look is—really, he did! I gave him directions, and he said it was payment!'\n'No, this isn't... um, these clothes are okay because they went through proceedings? You said something about application proceedings—how do you do that?'\n'This pelt is my friend's. I miss her a lot.'\nLunacub declined HR's proposal to provide her with a standard-issue Rhodes Island tent.",
