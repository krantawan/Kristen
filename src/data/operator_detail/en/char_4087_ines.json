            "storyText": "When Ines first came to Rhodes Island, many colleagues were intrigued by this enigmatic operator who seemed to appear and disappear at will. Most shared the same question: What kind of woman could fight alongside W for such a long time?\nAnd so, many of them attempted to approach her, but the result was many 'expert' trackers among the Lupos returning empty-handed. They could not determine Ines's whereabouts.\nAs the number of failed attempts increased, the operators on the ship started taking the 'Find Ines' game more seriously. After all, not everyone would willingly admit that the Sarkaz mercenary, who spent so much time in the wilds, possessed recon and counter-recon skills surpassing our well-trained operators.\nInterviews with the participants all mentioned shadowy marks deliberately left by Ines during their attempts to track her. These marks laid bare what they held dear or feared deep in their hearts. There are no secrets before her, making the operators both fearful and grave when dealing with her.\nIn recent days, Dr. Kal'tsit finally intervened to put an end to these games. However, a simple tracking investigation is the least effective approach. I believe my understanding of Ines far surpasses that of the others.\nI reexamined the progression of the entire incident and realized that most were drawn in by Ines's outstanding abilities and overlooked two major doubts.\nDoubt one: Despite her extensive experience in intelligence work, she couldn't possibly have immediately familiarized herself with the full layout of the ship upon her arrival at Rhodes Island, let alone better than the operators who had lived on board for years. I speculate that Ines must have boarded this ship a long time ago, possibly spending a significant period of time here. Considering she faked death records, I also have a bolder hypothesis.\nDoubt two: While there is a wide variety of recorded Sarkaz Originium Arts, there are few accounts of mind probing or emotional interference. Moreover, such Arts are more prevalent in certain areas of Leithanien. However, Ines has been active in the Kazdel region for a long time, indicating a more direct connection.\nThus, I started my investigation with Ines's former partner, W. I cross-referenced logs and documents in the archive for major events over the past decade and, remarkably, found Ines's presence in each of them. During all these events, she has always stayed clear of the center of action, but seemed to be restrained by an inescapable force, preventing her from truly breaking free. Perhaps I need to request a higher clearance to investigate further. I feel I'm getting close to uncovering Ines's secrets.\n[Classified Log]\nInes initiated contact with this overly curious desk worker, who subsequently abandoned further investigation. This record has been requested to be filed and sealed. I have reassigned him to a department where he can better utilize his talents. This is also to prevent him from causing similar issues for other operators.\n—■■■",

            "storyText": "Unlike your run-of-the-mill wandering Sarkaz mercenaries, Ines has changed teams a few times in her lengthy career. Betrayal and animosity were common in the Scar Market, yet regardless of how her employers changed, Ines always seemed loyal to her partner—Hoederer.\nWhether the word 'loyalty' accurately describes it or not, Ines has refused to reveal more about her personal relationships. Since the Victoria Incident, Rhodes Island's contact with Sarkaz forces has become more frequent. Ordinary operators were not aware of that background, but for those of us who have been with Dr. Kal'tsit and Amiya for some time, seeing an old acquaintance didn't feel nostalgic so much as heavy.\n—Anonymous Sarkaz operator\n\nInes may be too shy to say it, but not Hoederer. I've heard the story of how they met, and they were probably just teenagers at the time. The Sarkaz don't really observe anniversaries, nor are they particularly aware of dates in battle. But I guess Ines still remembers those days.\nShe remembers how she, in the white birch forest, was forced to stain her hands with fresh blood, how she survived by hook and by crook. She remembers how that Sarkaz youth with a knife suddenly descended from the sky, coldly counting bodies, calculating bounties, and unexpectedly extending a hand to her... When Hoederer talks about these things, his expression doesn't change at all. He talks like he's recounting a war story. He doesn't even blush!\nIn any case, shortly thereafter, Ines became Hoederer's right-hand woman, even though the young Hoederer didn't have his own team at the time. According to him, after leaving the white birch forest, Ines spent each day honing her skills physically and also modifying them with Arts, all to become a true Sarkaz.\nWhat? Invading an employee's privacy? Do you really think it's beneficial for Rhodes Island when a Sarkaz mercenary uses 'privacy' as an excuse to conceal her history and relationships? That's called due diligence!\nFurthermore, they've been partners for so many years and have even worked with Ascalon and Scout. You make it sound like all that can stay under wraps... Huh? Fear of retaliation? Her Arts? Oh my... In an office shadow-stepping contest, only Ascalon can beat me. Wait, do her Arts not require contact with shadows?\n—■■■\n\nInes has always maintained a certain distance from other mercenaries—and operators. Her Originium Arts make her uniquely skilled at knowing how to treat others with caution—especially on the battlefield. But Ines doesn't preclude herself from interpersonal interactions because of this. She understands well the benefits that come with investing 'trust' in the right people, and her Arts happen to be adept at screening for 'trust.'\nTherefore, during the Kazdel civil war, Ines's skills as a spy were without equal. Her nurturing of informants and orchestration of defections were always impeccable. Perhaps Rhodes Island doesn't have need of these brutal methods right now, but I hope the Doctor recognizes her abilities as a soldier—not just an operator—and will manage to win her 'trust.' She used to be very distrustful... of who you were then.\nBy the way, among the 'Rhodes Island operators' that the Doctor is familiar with, Scout was among the first to earn Ines's 'trust.' As for Chernobog, Ines will one day clarify things herself. I won't speak for her.\n—Ascalon\n\nAhaha, that night in the white birch forest, that's too good, need a copy of this. Let Kal'tsit know for me.\n—Anonymous access record; even though I can guess who did it, HR gave up the investigation for security reasons.",

Thanks to Hoederer, I overthink lots of things I shouldn't, but it's only clarified my one goal—to stay alive.\nW is... obtuse. She never realized the implications of her Sarkaz identity, what she bears. She dedicates too little time to reflection, blindly adopting that elusive ideal as her purpose in life.\nYou guided her down that path, but I don't think you've really thought through the consequences it might have on her again. Your shadow tells me you have your own plans, and you better know where she stands in them.\nHmph, I'm not asking for your word; that's not worth much to a Sarkaz. As long as she insists, I'll trust you once again, but this time, I'll be there by her side, the both of us will.\nI'm just a mercenary. The most brutal price I can pay is to be broken and shattered one more time. Luckily, I'm familiar enough with the experience that it doesn't scare me anymore.\nYes, you can take that as a threat.

Smugglers are eager to incite various mercenary factions through covert manipulation or direct bounties. However, these foreigners walking the paths of Kazdel have also become lucrative prey for mercenaries. Many arms smugglers from Leithanien and small contractors from Columbia have gambled everything only to be left empty-handed after a raid.\nAs a mercenary operating in Kazdel, Ines had her share of such operations. She once witnessed her team swiftly wipe out a convoy of Leithanian smugglers, leaving behind only a Caprinae boy. Such displaced foreign children in Kazdel are not rare; after their parents' deaths, they hold no value. Sarkaz aren't inclined to bother with them, either leaving them to fend for themselves or driving them into the harsh northern forests to experience the land's cruelty.\nSarkaz mercenaries revel in such 'entertainment.' There must be someone to exact revenge for the flames these smugglers help fan, and these bewildered young outsiders often make the best targets. As for the Caprinae boy, Ines did what a Sarkaz should. She gave him two choices—stay by his parents' corpses and perish, or be thrown into the solitude of the northern birch forests to die alone.\n'Why not give the boy a chance? He's no threat.'\n'Only a Sarkaz can survive in Kazdel. Before I tossed him into the forest, I gave him a file to use. His one lifeline.'\nPerhaps Rhodes Island can save the unfortunate souls before us, but what about those we can't even perceive? Our abilities are ultimately limited. The chaos of Kazdel is like a vortex, drawing in all ambitious ripples, brewing greater waves, waiting to engulf everything.\n'Stow the excess sympathy. At least until the day when the war ends for real.'\nAnd for those operators doubting the authenticity of Ines's words, she'd recommend they take a trip to the northern birch forests.\n'The only difference between me and that Caprinae is I walked out of the forest and survived to this day. I learned from it.'\nShe describes it as a place filled with not only bones and beauty, but also traces of the many who tried to survive.\n'In those forests lies the secret to surviving in Kazdel.'\n'It's not every time that someone comes to your rescue,' Ines concludes softly.",
