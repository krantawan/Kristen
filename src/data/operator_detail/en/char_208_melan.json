In both life and on the battlefield, they maintain a strong and complementary relationship. \nMelantha also has great respect for the mature and dependable Operator Steward. She feels both guilty and grateful to Ansel, who is in charge of maintaining her health records as well as providing her with daily treatment. Finally, Adnachiel is the Operator that Melantha understands the least. Since the beginning, she has struggled to figure out what this kid from Laterano might be thinking. Nevertheless, Adnachiel hasn't caused any problems in battle. \nDuring her tenure as captain, her subordinates have all spoken highly of her attentive and careful nature.

This is one of Melantha's few mysteries. \nJudging from test records and daily battle videos, her swordsmanship appears to have originated from the Victorian traditional duelist's style, but at some point during her training, she must have picked up some heavy influences from Eastern sword arts. \nMelantha's weapon can also be looked at as a kind of circumstantial evidence for this. She uses an exceptionally fine yet extremely sharp straight sword. Current data makes clear that this weapon is only used in Yan and some parts of the Far East. \nMelantha's swordsmanship is agile and her skills are outstanding. In terms of combat techniques, Melantha has is skilled in tactical assault. Even without support, she can rely upon her mobility to move about the battlefield and hide when necessary. \nOn the other hand, Melantha lacks the ability for effective direct confrontation and she displays certain deficiencies in stability during high-intensity operations.\nUp until now, Melantha has trained under the guidance of Franka.",
