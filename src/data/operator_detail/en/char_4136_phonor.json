Compared to other wheeled operation platforms, the witchcraft-based components in her operating mechanisms, drive system, and core more closely resemble a mobile altar. Despite being the product of both cutting-edge technology and Sarkaz witchcraft, her basic specs are unimpressive, but she is easy to deploy and able to provide mid-mission assistance to operators.

They were curious as to how much this emissary of the Banshees would affect Logos's personal life. There were also busybodies like Closure who took an interest in the former Great Banshee. After all, 'sending one's voice over' was seen as an incredibly strange act to other Sarkaz.\nIn the end, though, nothing really changed. Logos paid no heed to the unusual 'elder' often by his side. At times, they would go on walks on the deck together. While Rhodes Island was preparing to leave Londinium, PhonoR-0 proved to be a big help in our final few operations. She even accepted being the subject of Closure's research without hesitation. Whenever she heard amusing anecdotes about Logos from other operators, she would politely ask them to repeat themselves slowly so she could record their stories and send them back to the Convallis of the Banshees.\nOn occasion, and <i>only</i> on occasion, operators having a few drinks at Just One More Pint would notice that PhonoR-0 had replaced the usual jukebox. Most times, she would simply quietly emit a red light while playing gentle melodies the operators at the bar had never heard. But whenever Logos came by, a melodious Banshee chant would find itself on the playlist. Her voice sounds as though it comes from the other side of this great land, passing through the Convallis and the crystal arches studded across the earth.\nIt was not long before she received an invitation to join Rhodes Island's choir.",
