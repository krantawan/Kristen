According to our investigation, this area was often affected by Catastrophes, rendering the land barren and unproductive. Unable to make a living or work the land, many locals have no choice but to provide their labor to prospective employers, and with high enough compensation, are willing to do almost anything. The tenuous grasp of Columbian authorities over this remote region has led to a chronic lack of proper policing, resulting in this area gaining notoriety as a chaotic and lawless land. \nCutter, who grew up under such an environment, chose to stake out her own lot in life to support herself like so many of her peers; but unlike many, she also established a set of rules to abide by, dictating what she would and would not do.",

Never participate in fraud or the trafficking of persons. \n3. If a bystander suffers losses to property during the task, then appropriate compensation must be paid afterwards. \n\nAs a result of these constraints, Cutter makes a lot less money than those who are far less skilled than she is, and this has complicated her living situation. Despite that, she never compromised or abandoned her code. One might surmise that this was a product of her chaotic environment, or perhaps due to a certain teacher she references in conversation. \nAccording to Cutter, her teacher was a wandering swordsman who traveled the world. This teacher not only raised her after her parents died fighting on the streets, but also taught her how to wield a blade. Under this person's tutelage, Cutter did not get swallowed by the lawlessness and wanton violence that claimed so many of her fellow villagers; instead, she became the principled mercenary that she is today. \nCutter's teacher quietly left after confirming that she could be self-sufficient, only leaving behind the pendant that now hangs around her neck - a carved protective charm that she cherishes immensely.",

For people like them who deal in blood, letting the goods escape doesn't just affect their reputation, it impacts their business, so they'll kill their friends, and it won't weigh on them one bit. But for the sake of this innocent girl, nothing will stop her.\nCutter conceals herself in the pitch-black night. A dull, bad sweetness emerges in her throat, reminding her of the blood that coated her under the blazing sun in times past. But the girl on her back grips Cutter's arms tight, reminiscent of that day years ago, when she herself gripped tight onto those machetes with no owner.\nShe pushes the girl up on her back, adjusting positions, freeing herself up.\nIn the interval where her taut nerves relax, the aches on her body come with—Cutter uses the moonlight to inspect their wounds on her. A bolt shot at them hours earlier cut her shoulder and the girl's arm, the blood of the two congealed together. In this moment, thanks to the movement, fresh blood finds a way to well from her shoulder again.\nCutter tilts her head to look, her mind beginning to ring thanks to this trouble from nowhere.\nThe rope that fate bound around her neck suddenly tightens, and Cutter begins to feel this instant that her very breathing is beginning to freeze. Her hands turn cold in an instant, her heart pounding in her ears with every pulse, and she feels this darkness will drown her.\nCutter stares in shock, rooted to the ground, the cut on her shoulder smoldering red.",
