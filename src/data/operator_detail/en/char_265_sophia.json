Whislash of competition knight lineage, however, doesn't care at all whether operators meet a uniform average, instead aspiring to bring each operator's own characteristics to their maximum potential. \nNeither's way of thinking is wrong, but even so, Dobermann and Whislash are both particularly stubborn. They were at an impasse for a while, before finally taking a meeting and reaching a compromise. \nThough perhaps they came to understand each other while butting heads. Ever since then, their relationship's gotten pretty good. You might hear them talking tactics from time to time now, or even just eating meals together.",

Strictly speaking, she cannot, since her standing is as a branch member of the Nearl family, which bars her from directly taking up the name. \nBut this was policy for the Nearl family at its shining peak. Following Nearl's exile, it might've been simple enough, with all that she possessed, to seize the title of Nearl if she so wished. \nMind you, Whislash did not. \nOne part of it was her sisterly relationship with Maria. The other, as she saw it, was that the Nearl name held hallowed significance. \nIn a certain sense, her opinion overlaps with a true direct relative of Nearl's and Blemishine's, their uncle, Młynar—'This is not a name I'd tarnish with such underhandedness.' \nThough, sure enough, they define 'tarnishing' in different ways. \nUnlike Młynar, Zofia does not reject the idea of the competition knight itself. Put another way, she accepts at least its existence—but does not err in her forthright and sporting approach to dueling, which she took to the competition as humble representative of the Nearl family. Unwilling to bow to any sponsors or firms, she went from start to finish lacking any favorable provisions or equipment, until the Final 16 brought her journey to an end. Even now, despite that gulf in equipment taking her left hand out of action indefinitely, she has no regrets. None—come the Major, she wants to make sure Blemishine continues to fight as she once did.  \nIt's plain how in Whislash's heart of hearts, her honor as a member of the Nearl family is unbreakable, and anyone could see how she looks after Nearl and Blemishine. When joining, she even assured us that if Rhodes Island wasn't fit for purpose, she'd prefer to take Nearl and Blemishine with her to raise them herself. We've had some personnel envy the sisters in a way, having an elder who cares for them like that.",

But as time passed, as other operators arrived, and showed her ever more ways of life from ever more corners of Terra... chatting with the Doctor one day, she posed a question she'd never thought of asking before—somehow, she'd never considered what she wanted to do herself.  \nSafeguarding the Nearl family name, looking after Nearl and Blemishine. These were what she wanted to do, but somehow not all she wanted to do. \nEver since Nearl was cast out, she'd found a new purpose for herself. Maria had jumped headlong into her beloved engineering. The name of Nearl was all but safe. Once everything she'd worried about no longer needed her, the realization struck her—she had no idea what should come next. \nBlessedly, the operators of Rhodes Island not only reminded her of life's variety, but that the vast majority of it was open to try herself. After a short period of haziness, Whislash decided to continue as an Instructor on the one hand, while trying all sorts of new things she'd never imagined on the other. She could seek out her new purpose in life. After all, she's young, life's long, and it's not like there's a rush.",

In effect, her opponent already knows her like the back of his own hand.\nShe had also heard that the Fissure's armor was forged specifically to take on her weapon of choice in battle. Not only does this armor make it difficult for her to get a good grasp with her whislash, any attack she manages to land isn't going to hurt her opponent in any way.\nOn the other hand, the blades yielded by her opponent have both been treated to give them fine cutting abilities.\nShe used to think these were just rumors. Alas, it all turned out to be true.\nZofia is starting to get discouraged. After all, her last few matches have all resulted in her defeat.\nHow many companies are there sponsoring Fissure? Are there really tens of thousands of people racking their brains together just to figure out how to take on the Whislash Knight?\nShe needs to find a way to get herself out of this, lest she gets defeated yet again.\nDid Nearl use to fight all by herself as she is doing now?\nDid she waver and hesitate when she found herself at a disadvantage?\nShe knows the answer, and she also knows very well that she is not Nearl.\nWhen her techniques, weapons, and armor are unable to give her any advantages, the only things she has to rely on are the same things that led Nearl to victory.\nConviction and determination.\nShe starts switching up her attack patterns, even using techniques that she has not yet completely mastered.\nShe's relying more on her blade than her whislash to attack.\nNow, Zofia the Whislash has a clear objective:\nShe must confuse her opponent.\nShe must wait for her opponent to become distracted for even a second.\nShe must snatch his weapon away with her whislash.\nAnd before its threads snap, she must strike her opponent down!",
