His main job was to protect Leonhardt from harm during his investigations and assessments of Catastrophes. Combined with Leonhardt's cleverness, the duo rarely run into sticky situations. Most of the time, Ayerscarpe only needs to accompany him on walks, help carry equipment, or listen to his friend's incessantly prattling about what he thinks is cool — at least until the moment when a crisis comes and he is required to perform his duties.\nThere are many ways for a bodyguard to protect his target. Some people prefer using defensive measures to mitigate the damage, others are good at arranging traps to deter an enemy's attack. However, Ayerscarpe's preferred method of defense is to eradicate the enemies. Though he is a man of few words, his ferocious attacks indeed confirm his status as an operator who believes that the best defense is a good offense.",

However, the operator himself is well-suited for carrying out his duties in this manner. In addition to having excellent combat skills and rapid reaction times, part of this operator's success is owed to the special weapon that he carries. \nThere has been no official name given to this weapon as of yet, and the nicknames that the operator himself has chosen, such as 'my baby,' or 'nice guy,' have no reference value whatsoever. Due to the operating mode of the weapon itself, we've temporarily named it 'RT-01.' \nSince there is no weapon or even weapon class similar to RT-01 within our scope of knowledge, we believe that this is an experimental weapon. According to Ayerscape, this weapon was purchased from Rim Billiton's black market. Rim Billiton has developed many small-scale private mining companies due to its robust mining industry. The turnover and conglomeration rate among these companies are high, which indirectly promotes the black market. Many resources will circulate here before eventually reaching the hands of private individuals, organizations, or even foreign forces. Because Ayerscarpe overcame great difficulties to acquire this weapon, and the weapon itself boasts excellent performance, he is extremely fond of RT-01. When asked to describe any deficiencies, he'll only point out that it 'produces some slight noise from time to time.' \nThe operator in charge of weapon inspections said he didn't hear anything, but Ayerscarpe insists that he hears it loud and clear.",

Leonhardt takes on jobs that require negotiation or involve minerals, and Ayerscarpe takes on tasks that require superior athleticism or uncovering things that can't be discovered by others. Don't be fooled by the fact that he often exchanges harsh words with his old friend — he will never make Leonhardt look bad in front of others, and if something ever happens to him, he is the first to rush over. When Leonhardt became a Catastrophe Messenger, Ayerscarpe volunteered to become Leonhardt's private bodyguard. Since Ayerscarpe acquired his unique set of weapons, it would be more profitable to take on jobs of his own rather than protecting the Catastrophe Messenger, but Ayerscarpe stubbornly insists on remaining his friend's bodyguard, while also making it clear that the other party needs to pay up. All in all, Leonhard, not wealthy in the first place, ended up allocating most of his salary to Ayerscarpe, ending up in an even tighter financial situation as a result. \nAlthough we didn't know how Ayerscarpe controlled these funds before, we were able to investigate the flow of funds between the two after he became an operator, and the results were mind-blowing. \nLeonhardt's concept of managing money is rather laissez-faire. While he is good at making money, he's also good at spending it. After joining Rhodes Island, his shopping list grew longer than ever due to stable living arrangements and a higher salary. Except for work-related tools such as dune buggies, which have questionable usability in general circumstances, Leonhardt's stash of new and interesting things has indeed been growing. Most of these items simply reflect his personal taste, but others are for gifting to young operators who he deems to 'not be cool enough,' and he often offers these gifts in a way that is hard to refuse. Sometimes, his consumption habits have caused been problematic, such as when he couldn't pay the bills one time. This time, he has had Ayerscarpe to cover for him.\nAyerscarpe's lifestyle has always been very frugal. Other than spending money on necessary living expenses and salted edamame, Ayerscarpe has been saving his money, and he basically returns the 'payment' he received from serving as Leonhardt's bodyguard to his friend at the right time. He knows that Leonhardt doesn't know how to save money, and he knows that sooner or later, he wouldn't be able to purchase something that he actually needed. At that time, he'll use that money to buy things for his friend and send it over to him. Even now when there is no direct financial connection between the two, he still often draws from his savings to fill in the gap for Leonhardt. Of course, he also knows that Leonhardt will repay him in due time. This is the mutual understanding formed after many years of cooperation, and demonstrates the trust between the two friends.",

The guy thinks he runs on electricity. \nI'm serious. \nI have no idea if his weapon electrocutes people, but when I see his ears tremble, I'm pretty sure there's some electricity involved. \nWhat's more, he always goes around asking those electricity-based operators if he can bum some electricity from them. \nI'm talking Greyy, that guy who fixes the electrical outlets, and Leizi. \nHe walked up to Leizi like a plank one day and asked, 'is there some way for me to quickly increase the charge my body can carry?' \nIs he stupid?! \nI feel even worse for that little Victorian hairstylist.

Prepare a device to freeze the edamame. I will use my own edamame box here as a demonstration: this much freezing is just right.\n3. Prepare a device to discharge electricity. I'll demonstrate with my trusty sidekick here: this much power leakage is just right.\n4. Lower the voltage of the discharge device and shock the edamame until the juice inside carries a slight charge.\n5. Eat.\n[Efficacy]\nIn the barrens, maintaining a clear mind can be a real challenge. The boundless wilderness, the sweeping dust storms, the glow reflecting from the active Originium clouds in the sky, the howl of the wind blowing through Originium crystal clusters... It's easy to gradually lose your sense of self and fall into a trance-like state where you won't notice incoming dangers.\nChew the edamame along with its shell. The hairs of the shell can stimulate the mouth, thus keeping the user's nerves active.\nFrozen edamame can stimulate the gums and make it easier to stay awake.\nThe slightly-charged juices can give a tingling jolt, thus sharpening the user's perception.\nProper stimulation can prevent people from falling into a stupor. This is the only way to survive in the wilderness.\n\n'You've put a weird amount of thought into this manual, Ayers.'\n'Quit flapping your gums, Leon. A lot of operators have been coming by the last few days, asking me for the secret to staying awake in the wilds. I'm sick of giving the same explanation again and again.'\n'I guess it's true that your manual could stop people from coming, but... to be honest, I'm surprised those hobbies of yours can actually come in handy.'\n'That's a nice bonus. Edamame is delicious, and I find the electric jolt refreshing.'\n'Well, whatever floats your boat. At first, I was worried you were forcing yourself to do all that just to stay awake protecting me...'\n'Do I seem like that kind of person?'\n'Not really. Remember the first time you ate edamame? With shell and everything? You didn't know to peel it back then and we were worried it'd cause some sort of problem, but instead you seemed happy as could be.'\n'I remember. That was when the mining ship broke down in the barrens. By the time we got it huffing and puffing to the next mine, everyone was already delirious with hunger. It was the first time I had food that could just snap you back to your senses, and it really stuck with me.'\n'Wait, so it all comes back to waking you up after all? You know, I'm starting to feel a little sorry for you, Ayers.'\n'No, it's because edamame is delicious, and I find the electric jolt refreshing.'\n'...Alright then. Whatever floats your boat.'"
