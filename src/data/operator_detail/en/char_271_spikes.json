However, aside from a few special cases, they are typically not allowed to remain in Laterano territory. Compared to the strict regulations many other countries and territories have for the Infected, you could say that only getting exiled from Laterano is far more lenient. That being the case, if you become Infected in Laterano, you must forever leave your homeland, never again to set foot on the place you grew up. To many Lateranos, this is understandably an unbearable proposition. \nOn his own initiative, operator Arene studied in Leithanien for years after contracting Oripathy. Consequently, the hometown that he can no longer return to may very well have become nothing but a faint memory to him long ago.",

To them, the Sankta and their guns are inseparable concepts, and the Sankta, with their halos above their heads, are never ones to part with their precious firearms. And whenever a Sankta is unable to keep a gun due to whatever extraordinary circumstance, they would usually choose the next best thing they are allowed: long-ranged weapons like bows. \nIn most cases, one would be correct to make such assumptions. That being said, there are some occasional exceptions to the norm. Operator Arene is one such exception at Rhodes Island. He is one of the few Sankta here to forgo the use of firearms, instead opting to use Originium Arts as his primary means of attack. \nThe Originium Arts that Operator Arene utilizes are somewhat unusual: his Arts tend to be have toxic, disintegrative, and corrosive traits. As a result, he normally keeps away from crowds in order to mitigate any unnecessary risks. And just like the impression that others typically have of Operator Arene himself, his Originium Arts typically strike others as beautiful yet dangerous, amicable yet seclusive, and requiring extra care to approach. \nDue to his frequent use of Arts, Arene himself usually carries a faint aromatic fragrance. The fragrance's effect on others is alterable at will, and can either be rendered completely harmless or made dangerously toxic during the most crucial situations.",

It is precisely for this reason that, when Arene contracted Oripathy several years ago, his parents opted to send him, their one and only son, away from danger to Leithanien instead of keeping him close by. \nRegretfully, both of his parents were killed during a recent clandestine operation to steal Laterano firearms technology. Their will unfortunately brought Arene plenty of trouble as well—most people seem to believe that a parent would always leave every last thing they treasured to their children. In reality, the only thing that Arene's parents ever wished for was for their only son to live a peaceful life. They knew their research would undoubtedly be taken up by Laterano departments far more up to the task than him. \nEven though the crisis has mostly been averted thanks to Operator Arene's master plan, there still remains enough of a risk that, in spite of the young man's temperament, the poor executor had to escort Arene to Rhodes Island to seek his colleague's help, before taking a temporary leave to deal with some so-called problematic follow-up work. \nDuring his childhood, Arene's parents were often preoccupied with work and had little time to spend with their son, leaving him alone at home most of his childhood. Young children often have a hard time understanding their parents' passion for work. To the young Arene, it was guns that had stolen his parents' attention from him, and that became the source of his apathy against guns, normally admired by Sankta children far and wide. Furthermore, after his infection during the accident, he lost any opportunity to have his own gun. \nPerhaps because he departed Laterano at an early age, Arene tends to be a little sheepish around some of our other Laterano operators. Instead, he is more proactive in interacting with our Leithanian operators. One such example is Operator Eyjafjalla. The two of them had studied under the same famous professor at their university, just barely enough to make them old classmates.",

After all, we have operators with all kinds of personalities here at Rhodes Island, even some particularly freewheeling Sarkaz mercenaries that we had to reluctantly learn to tolerate. Compared to them, the young boy's tendency to play pranks on operators or his mildly sadistic attitude toward his enemies were hardly issues at all. \nHowever, when Arene brought an enemy combatant back with him after an operation and then half-jokingly suggested practicing new Originium Arts on him, it became obvious to us that it was perhaps not a good idea to afford our still-growing adolescent operators total, unrestricted freedom. Operator Arene should no longer be allowed to do whatever he pleases. The young, sensitive Sankta is in dire need of proper guidance and instruction that, cruicially, do not bore him.",

Anyone who tries to take a look at his notebook will—'\n'I'm more inclined to believe he's hiding something shady in there, like data from human experimentation. The last time I saw him with a prisoner—'\n'If you ask me, he's just going through a rough patch in life. He's probably just keeping a diary to sort through his feelings.'\nThey speculate, they doubt, but the young man simply smiles at the various comments.\nHe sets the notebook down on his desk and flips it open.\nHe pulls out a transparent fountain, as if drawing an overly sharpened dagger, and fills it with the brightly colored ink he made himself, purported to be laced with deadly toxin\n'The voices of others are important, but it's your own answers that matter most.\n'Write down whatever you want to tell me, and yourself, the most.'\nGuns that have killed, poison with a deceiving aroma, blurry voices, the cruelty and malice inexorably hidden deep within... Many things cross his mind.\nWhen his senses return to him, he realizes that the tip of the pen has punctured the page again, the brightly-colored ink seeping into the snow-white paper like the bloodied, grasping limbs of enemies, until everything contorts into a bottomless vortex.\nArene lets out a chuckle and casually tears out the besmirched sheet of paper.\nHe then closes the notebook and stashes it back in his pocket.",
