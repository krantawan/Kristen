It is terrifyingly devastating when released in small, confined spaces. \nHowever, these Arts drain a lot of energy from Liskarm, exhausting her completely. Therefore, Blacksteel commanders often pair her with a melee specialist.

She even bought into that view in the past. \nBut her steady-does-it and stubbornly patient personality always compelled her to devote more time and effort than her peers to fulfilling her goals. When she was an intern with Blacksteel, Liskarm tagged along on every sortie they would allow, starting at the bottom and working her way up to become a reliable, competent security specialist. \nLiskarm's hometown is located in an area controlled by the Vouivre Alliance, a small city primarily relying on mining, quarrying and stone processing. To maintain the viability of these industries, the city often operated in the deserts and mountains near the mines and quarries--where nomadic robbers and their mercenary cohorts roamed. \nTo counter potential raids, the city formed a defense force, but inadequate training and poor equipment forced it to turn to more reputable security contractors. \nThe contractors who fiddled with newfangled weaponry and equipment, speaking to each other in foreign languages, repelling invaders in the blink of an eye were Liskarm's very first memory of the business. \nShe wasn't interested in money or the thrill of combat. She just wanted to use her weapons to bring peace, not chaos, to the people.",

Do you read me—'\n'...[KZZT]...[KZZT]...'\nThey laid an Arts trap specifically to separate us. Seems they aren't taking chances with our teamwork.\nShe takes a headcount of the nearby hostiles. Five left, three right, seven dead ahead, for 15 total. All Vouivre, all kitted with blackout sunglasses and insulated shields.\nOkay, then. They know us too well. They were expecting us.\nWe used to run into gangs and bandits here, drifters. This is different. They're organized, equipped, and tactical. They've been trained by a professional. Who?\n'Why is this the way you come home to Vouivre, Blacksteel merc?'\nThe voice came from deep in this ruined skyscraper, and been altered by Originium Arts. Whoever's talking doesn't plan to expose their identity. For now.\nThe enemy's formed a circle. The shade-and-shield guys are trotting in. Good, just a little closer.\nI bring up my shield, feeling heat gather at my horntips. I fill up my chest. My pulse and breathing both skip a beat. I shut my eyes, and thunder claps about my ears. I open my eyes again, momentarily dazed.\n'You see now? Vouivre's not the same place you left.'\n'Her Arts failed! Get her!' Ahead, the hostiles' insulated shields are scorched and blistered, and they've let their guard down. Good.\nI unclip the lightweight device from my tactical vest. I remember what the Engineering ops named it. The Experimental Photocapacitive Grenade. My 'Stunner's Storage'.\nWith my fingertip as a casting medium, the photocap's Originium circuits make a crack like a bullet. I toss it through the air, and my ears ring yet again.\nThe cramped ruins flash with another round of blinding light, and the photocap's stored current arcs through the air and the seared shields. The hostiles yell as they go down. Fifteen voices.\n'Good shit, Blacksteel merc. So you brought these little toys back to Vouivre?'\n'I know what I'm here to bring back.\n'But before I do, I want you the hell out of Vouivre first!'"
