As an extension of his interests, he also has some knowledge in electrical appliances. \nHowever, unlike Broca, though Chiave is generally well-liked among other operators, he is often described as 'having a bad rap.' \nBecause of his tendencies to push the boundaries in all aspects of life and work, he often adds truly head-scratching modifications to the things he's working on.

He is very ordinary in many respects, and the sum of his combat effectiveness can be regarded as average at best. He is prone to flights of fancy, and often does things half-heartedly. To be frank, it would not be surprising if he was found dead in a ditch on the side of the road one day. \nHowever, this is what's astounding about him. \nLet's do something a bit dramatic to illustrate the point— Everyone in the room will say 'Chiave? Oh, that arrogant guy.' But without fail, most people will smile and add another sentence — 'But that's just the kind of person he is.' And some of these people will not hesitate to help him when they learn that he is in trouble. This is a good indicator of Chiave's popularity. He always leaves a deep impression upon others that makes it impossible to truly hate him. \nOf course, speaking from another angle, if he really was to suddenly leave us prematurely, most people would probably get over it pretty quickly, because 'that's just the kind of person he is.' \nThat is the contradictory and fascinating person that Chiave is.",

She's withdrawn but decently polite, seems to be a well-raised young lady, but none of that's what he's really focused on.\nNo, Chiave's started noticing her because she keeps coming to the garage, but she's got nothing to fix. Not just that, but she keeps walking over to him, asking him questions about work. She struck him as the annoying sort of amateur, the kind he'd just say a few words to get off his back. Later, though, something made him change his mind about her: a customer came complaining to his boss about how Chiave installed vertical jets and sprayed graffiti on his car without permission while fixing it up, and filed it all under repair costs. The girl made herself known at that point, said she thought Chiave's mods were super sick, and even footed the compensation for him.\n'Huh, this chick's got some taste,' was Chiave's mental comment.\nOne day, she shows up in front of Chiave again, this time with a fancy cake for him. He wants to refuse her, but she says, 'I'll get fat if I eat too much cake, so I may as well give the rest to you,' pushing him to begrudgingly accept it. He's surprised to find, though, that he's had this kind of cake before, and it's his favorite. He's got a million thanks for the girl, so he decides to get her a precious gift in return, the likes of which have never been seen before. He explains his idea his buds—Broca and Aosta—and asks them to help out. Broca's naturally on planning and prototyping duty, and Aosta's not so convinced by Chiave's proposition, but reluctantly designs the exterior and gives input on some of the finer details, while Chiave himself handles the imagination bomb he's throwing down in the making of it all. Finally, after working several nights straight, the three's masterpiece of blood and sweat is ready to see the light of day.\nThe next time the girl visits the garage, everything plays out as they envisioned. With music playing that Broca put on in advance, Chiave (with some effort) presents her with the gift, and recites his speech: 'You like it? It's a jack I made especially for you! Even if you get fatter now, you can hoist yourself up into your car with this. You'll never need to worry about packing on weight again.'\nAnd since then, not once has the girl been seen at the garage again. But in the Chiave Gang's collection, there is now an unusually shaped, repainted jack, serving as an heirloom of the Chiave Gang to be forever stowed away.",
