On the other hand, mildly infected individuals like Jackie aren't able to channel much energy for Arts. \nFor this reason, even Infected Casters often prefer to cast Arts through an Arts Unit whenever possible. Similarly, Rhodes Island provides an Arts Unit to every Caster operator. \n——In fact, the Engineering Department is very passionate about designing Arts Units of all shapes and sizes. One of their favorite pastimes is developing 'Arts Units' that look nothing like conventional units— and often don't work at all. \nThe Arts Unit that hangs at Jackie's waist, gun-type Arts Unit PT-29, is the pride of the Engineering Department. \nRegrettably, even though Jackie applied for such an Arts Unit, it is only due to a habit formed while serving as an auxiliary police officer. Jackie herself is incredibly uninterested in the subject of Arts and her scores are very disappointing. Because of this, this Arts Unit is mostly an accessory to this day.",

Some of her teammates can even recite her entire speech from beginning to end by heart now. \nHer story may be hyperbolic to some extent, but her father was still willing to bring his own infected daughter to Rhodes Island in person. Throughout his short stay in Rhodes Island, he never openly displayed any animosity towards the other Infected, and even remained agreeable to his daughter joining Rhodes Island after learning about some of Rhodes Island's more dubious activities. At the very least, he is not overly biased towards the Infected, even if he is just exercising self-restraint. That alone is already very rare amongst the non-Infected. \nJackie's good manners and lively attitude in daily life is likely also a result of her father's teachings. \nFrom that perspective, her father is indeed a policeman worth respecting, and a good father.",

After coming to Rhodes Island, not only did this ability allow her to befriend others easily, it also gave her a new goal——To help the other Infected. \nBesides curing her Oripathy, she also wants to lend a hand to the other Infected.

      "desc": "Earlier this week, law enforcement officials announced that the major kidnapping case that occurred earlier this weekend in Fussen Furnitureville has been cracked. All suspects are now in custody, and all hostages have been rescued and are currently receiving hospital treatment. Based on facts previously made available by the police, the syndicate responsible has been active in this state as well as our three neighbors, with a focus on hijacking and kidnapping. Seventeen cases this year alone have been linked to them, all striking panic in the populace. Working across state lines to follow developments in the case, Homeland Security employed disciplined units under a single chain of command to finally put this malicious gang behind bars. Justice has finally been served, and the citizens' lives and property safe once again.\nHowever, this week some have continued raising doubts about the police announcement, claiming that credit for the breakthrough goes to a young officer from the auxiliary forces, who is presently unnamed but has captured public attention in recent days. Following the end of the case, footage from a number of mall cameras has circulated on the intercity net. They show a young Perro female in a city police uniform but without a badge hopping onto the furniture store's roof from a nearby building, marking the start of a one woman chase—and eventually brawl—with the gangsters, lasting a whole forty minutes, and ending with her pacifying them all before law enforcement arrived bizarrely late to the scene. The young woman in the video is exceptionally athletic, making use of furniture from every room of the house to contend with the gangsters, skillfully enough to leave many wide-eyed. In the most viral clip, eight of them have her surrounded with edged and bolt-loaded weapons, then in the blink of an eye she grabs a mysterious weapon—said by the store's owner to be no more than a steel chair whose unique design struggled to sell—after which she subdues all the gangsters in short order. The public will not be forgetting her heroism any time soon.\nIn response to these inquiries, law enforcement official have stated that despite her nonstandard uniform, the woman in footage was in fact a special agent they dispatched to the precinct to secretly tail the gang, with orders to take action from within and subdue the criminals. The idea that the footage shows a 'vigilante' or 'police nonfeasance' is categorically false, and rumors that their department and the criminals were 'in cahoots' are not only utterly baseless, but 'harmful to police image.'\nIn contrast, eyewitnesses report that after singlehandedly taking down over a dozen gangsters and freeing the hostages, the mysterious young woman was promptly arrested and taken away by police. Some have even identified her as possibly the valorous officer who rescued a number of people during a major Originium safety accident last year, and exposed the former mayor's misdeeds. Law enforcement officials have yet to comment on this. We have made a request for this 'special agent' to come to our station for an interview, which the police have refused, citing her current hospitalization."
