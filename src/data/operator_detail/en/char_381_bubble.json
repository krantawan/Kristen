The two hit it off from the first time they met, and one always goes looking for the other whenever she has free time. As for what they talk about, it's what kids always love to talk about: \n'My favorite hero could beat up your favorite hero.' \nBubble doesn't like to study, but that hasn't kept her from learning all kinds of new phrases, techniques, and rhetorical flourishes to describe her own father during her talks with Ceobe. But the funny thing is that no matter how much vocabulary they prepare beforehand, their arguments always descend into: 'I'm big!' 'I'm bigger!' 'I'm way bigger!' Punctuated with exaggerated gestures, such confrontations can last an entire afternoon.  \nI suppose that's just how kids are. \nLooks like they're having fun.",

And one way she acted out against our environment was to rampage through the ship, wrecking things. \nDon't underestimate Bubble because of her size. She's trampled robots, crashed through security doors, broken down partition walls, and never once injured herself. Should you ever see her preparing to break into a run, stop her immediately and bring her to the nearest treadmill. Or toss her into the training room, which is the safest and most effective way to deal with a 'Bubble Crisis.' \nBubble also likes to run around the battlefield during combat. Thanks to her man-sized spiked shield, she is impervious to any threat she can charge straight through. But she tends not to consider that she could still be attacked from the side or the rear, and it is necessary to have other operators cover her. Until she is able to fully comply with dispatch or complete her Defender examination, her deployments will be limited to lower threat missions.",

Because of her bottomless respect for her father, Bubble has been working to emulate him since she was small. But we have to ask: is Bubble really suited to that kind of life? \nWhen other children in the tribe were learning the importance of combat skills, Bubble was rushing around, charging into things. She has far more strength and endurance than children of her same cohort, but combat prowess is more than just strength. In the words of her father: 'This girl will not be a warrior.' \nIt is perhaps because he recognized this that her father did not permit Bubble to conceal her wounds and carry on with her life, and instead sent her away from the tribe, away from Sargon, and off to a new future of her own making. \n'At least here, she can have a happy life.' It's hard to imagine such words came from a fierce tribal Cerato warrior, his body well over two meters tall covered head to toe in tattoos and totems. Not long after that conversation, our newly arrived Bubble came crashing through the reception room door. Her father apologized profusely to the operator on duty, all the while holding the crying Bubble by her ear. An hour later, after the operator saw off Bubble's father, the young girl helped herself to a snack: the leaves of our potted plant. \nIt seems Bubble has a lot of growing up to do.",

After attempting to resist Gavial several times, to no avail, Bubble has resigned herself to her fate. \nSubsequently, Bubble came to understand Gavial's 'glorious accomplishments' and has since come to worship her. \nAnd Bubble has been more amenable of late. \nThanks, Gavial! \nWhat's more, Bubble has started studying some close combat techniques. When asked why, she replied: \n'I want to pound Kay flat!' \nWe know that when Bubble and Ceobe get into one of their 'My Papa could beat up Vulcan' sessions, they sometimes get too into it and the conflict turns physical. They have never drawn weapons and do not escalate beyond shoving. \nIn terms of raw power, Bubble is a bit stronger than Ceobe, but Ceobe's extensive experience and conditioned reflexes always put Bubble at a disadvantage, and the noisy little firecracker usually finds herself overwhelmed.  \nSo Bubble started training. And property damage due to Bubble has also enjoyed a significant reduction. \nMaybe it won't be long before we can declare 'Bubble Crises' a thing of the past.",

Each of the heroes, seemingly just as young as them, had a shiny and glowy Originium blade and could use super-awesome techniques that made the whole screen flicker and shine like crazy, and it got everyone watching all pumped up. But then Shamare, who's always so cold, was there all alone like 'that sword's obviously just a toy' like she didn't get the mood at all.\nBubble wasn't one to say much about weapons, really. Swords were all light and fragile, and they'd never beat the cool stuff like giant axes and hammers.\nBut when she saw the friends she'd watched the film with get together one day and bring swords out, that really drove her nuts.\nThey were just like the ones in the movie! The shininess, the little button, and the dashing-ness that exuded from her friends when they lifted their swords to the air and yelled out the super-awesome move name.\nAnd like that, a need to HAVE overtook Bubble's heart.\nShe couldn't steal anyone's—she'd been scolded enough times already for that—but she had no idea how she'd get one like that for herself.\nBy buying it? How? From who? With what? She didn't even know how many rooms were inside this metal plate box, not to mention her friends were telling her they got shipped in from Kazimierz and she can't buy one now.\nWhy can't Bubble get the thing she wants?! It was all her mind could dwell on, but here she is now, and she doesn't know anything, except that aside from stealing someone else's she's got no way of getting the toy. But the lessons she's been having lately, and the sense of morals educated into her, stifle her urge to snatch one.\nSo now Bubble can only storm around in a huff, carelessly knocking into things and yelling loudly to vent her discontent. On occasion, when she tuckers herself out, she hides away in her dorm, crying as she hugs her tribe's totem.\nThis helplessness weighs down on Bubble very, very hard.\nMorte tastes this morsel and shares it with Shamare. After getting the rough gist of things, Shamare seeks out a psychological consultant operator at Medical, and very soon thereafter, a message is sent from HR out to Sargon...\nToday is Bubble's annual 'See Papa Day,' in which her father has agreed to come visit her once a year. It's the most important day of the year to her (aside from her birthday), and Bubble forces herself to shape up and look strong, to meet Papa with a smile. Even still, once she sees him, the gloom in her heart all spills out as tears, and she can't even put her words together properly, only lie in her Papa's arms and cry away.\nAfter the tears are done, she jumps out of her Papa's embrace, and sits silently on the couch again. And surprise! From his rucksack, her father pulls out a toy sword.\nIt's in this instant that Bubble's eyes shine like stars."
