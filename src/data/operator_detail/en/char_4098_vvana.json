The operator was only able to see her antlered, snow-white silhouette from behind, not moving an inch.\n'Maybe she's going through some kind of training. Best not to interrupt her.'\nThe operator thought, and left the grape aisle to fertilize the seedbeds further inside the greenhouse.\nWhen the operator finished her work and was about to head back to rest, she entered the grape aisle to find Viviana still standing there. This time, she was facing her, and she noticed her hands clasped together, with her right thumb knocking the back of her left hand rhythmically. Aside from this, she wasn't moving at all. Leisurely, she simply stood there in the corridor.\nThen she opened her eyes.\nShe pointed her finger at her antlers, and asked the operator if she could help her out.\nIt was only then that the operator noticed that her colleague, who had been motionless the whole time like a statue in a museum, had actually gotten her antlers caught in the grapevines and was unable to free herself.\nShe quickly grabbed a pair of pruning shears, and carefully cut the vines for Viviana. After the brief commotion, Viviana was freed.\n......\nAfter that, the two of them sat on a stone bench next to the grape aisle and had a short chat. Viviana was going to walk through the corridor to the flowerbeds on the other side to check on the marigolds' growth, only to find the grapevines had gotten tangled on her antlers as she was walking past. She tried to free herself at first, only to find herself getting more and more stuck as she struggled, eventually landing in that predicament.\nThe Logistics operator was about to ask her why she didn't seek help. After all, there were many operators in the Convalescent Garden. If she'd yelled, she wouldn't have had to suffer like that. But when she noticed Viviana describing the flora's fragrance so vividly and in such detail, as well as how she turned the automatic sprinkler's noise into a rhythm, she opted not to ask such a stupid question.\n'For someone as poetic as her, perhaps a sudden, unexpected event like this was only a part of her art,' the Logistics operator thought to herself.\nThe chat did not go on very long. The Logistics operator had other tasks to attend to, but when they parted ways, Viviana gave her a grapevine crown, made from the same vines that were just cut. The operator had been looking at her eyes the whole time and didn't notice her making the crown at all.\nAfterwards, Viviana walked through the grape aisle and disappeared among the Convalescent Garden's flowerbeds.",

            "storyText": "When she informed Młynar that a campaign knight swordstaff with the Nearls' crest had appeared in Kargereich, the two of them returned to Kazimierz and informed Margaret. The news undoubtedly affected the Nearls greatly. It implies that Margaret's parents and Młynar's brother and sister-in-law had left behind a tiny clue to their whereabouts. Viviana has a deep understanding of the dangers of Kargereich. Not to mention that the Nearl family does not currently have the slightest clue how to reenter that strange unreality, and with Margaret still occupied with helping the Infected of Kazimierz, it would perhaps be a long time before they could investigate...\nSo Viviana promised Margaret that she would provide all the help she could. At the same time, she also sought her advice regarding her future. Although she had returned to Kazimierz, that did not mean she would once again become a competition knight—she had long since tired of that status. Although her foster mother, Rossi the Grand Knight, had lunch with her on the day of her arrival and expressed her concern, she was unable to find Viviana a place to go. Returning to Leithanien was also not an option in the short term. After she pondered this over and over, Viviana was even prepared to return to Ognisko to continue her pastoral lifestyle.\nHowever, Margaret was able to read the hint of helplessness in her words and knew that her friend would not be satisfied with simply living a quiet life. Hiding deep within her heart there was a desire to help those around her, however possible. But because of her experiences and perspective, she had yet to find her way. Margaret was naturally more than happy to help with this. As such, she recommended Rhodes Island—Not its Kazimierzian offices, but Rhodes Island itself.\nViviana had heard a few things about what they had done in Kazimierz: They led a well-trained team of operators to help the Infected and dealt with all the corporations of the General Chamber of Commerce. This rather piqued her interest, and as she listened to Margaret's descriptions, she noticed something even more special about them she found attractive: Rhodes Island could provide her the opportunity to go somewhere far away from both Leithanien and Kazimierz, where she could once again seek out poetry and stories. And when Margaret told her about the time she faced Reunion in Chernobog and mentioned the Doctor and Amiya, the smile in the corner of her mouth and her unusually resolute eyes both got Viviana very curious. The changes Margaret went through from the time she quietly left Kazimierz after winning the championship, to her return to the Grand Knight Territory and taking the crown once more—before subsequently settling down—must have all been thanks to her time with Rhodes Island. What exactly was this island like, for the Radiant Knight, as impetuous yet unadaptable as she is, to become someone able to withstand the pressure of the GCC and stay in the Grand Knight Territory? What kind of place could earn such trust and loyalty from the knight she so admires? What kind of bewitching powers does the leader known as the 'Doctor' possess? She wanted to see it all with her own eyes.\nAnd so, a few weeks later, Viviana arrived on Rhodes Island.",

            "storyText": "There was a power outage in the library, and the room fell into darkness. Although the administrator tried to raise his voice to calm the operators reading there, he was unable to quell the circulating complaints. Naturally, Viviana was already used to this kind of darkness. She took out her sword, placed it by the table, and used her Arts to light up a candle on her sword to continue reading the epic she had borrowed. Ever since she was small child, this was how she would always read. A small candle is more than enough to completely dispel an entire swath of darkness. When she was young, she relied on the light of a candle to read her books. There was much that she was unable to do in darkness, and perhaps the only resistance she could put up was to light a candle.\n......\nViviana lifted her head to find a great number of operators gathered around her. They all wanted to keep reading, but none wanted to leave the library, and so they had gathered around this lonely light source. Viviana pondered a little, and used her Arts to light up the candle on the other end of her sword. Immediately, the long table she occupied was enveloped by a warm glow. The operators around her all expressed their gratitude, and she simply nodded and continued reading. Before, in the arenas, her candlelight was much more radiant than it now was. It was able to outshine the flashes of the cameras and the spotlights of the arena. Men gushed after her like surging tides as they yelled her title. Everyone had smiles on their faces, carefully choosing the words they showered her with, yet in their hearts—and Viviana knew this better than anyone—they were all trying to extract value from her. There were flames of greed burning in the eyes of her colleagues in the Nova Knightclub, and there were flames of fervor burning in the eyes of her fans. It was the light of these flames that lit the Grand Knight Territory. Her candlelight was but a part of this light, and this light of sickness was exhausting to her. And so she extinguished her own candlelight and walked into the darkness.\n......\nThey huddled around the tableside candlelight and continued reading for a good while. The administrator then walked in and pointed out that the power had been restored, and they had to flip the switch in the breaker box back on, but as it would be very difficult to work alone in the dark, he asked if Viviana would be willing to help guide the way. Viviana kept her sword by the tableside, and lit her own candle holder. The faint flame brought with it an enormously bright glow that lit the library up like daylight. The administrator walked ahead of her, as she followed with her candle held high. As she looked on at the silhouette that straddled between darkness and light, she couldn't help but think back on what she had endured in Kargereich. There had been no one to guide her. She could only raise the candle in her hand by herself and attempt to find something in that darkness. She walked past countless herselves, each with a candlelight that lit, only to go out. In the end, all that was left was— The administrator reached the breaker box, and he signaled to her that she may now put her candle away. Thus, she waved her hand. The flames on the candle holder and her sword all extinguished at once, and a darkness befell the space around them. Emptiness, hollowness, and the freezing cold. These were once the things she was most afraid of. But she had gotten through all of them. The ice-cold darkness of her childhood was unable to defeat her, nor the hollow darkness of Kargereich after she had grown up. Is it because she is the light that illuminates the dark, or is it because she is the darkness itself?\nThe lights of the library slowly lit up, and everything returned to normal. Viviana returned to her table, picked up her book, and continued reading.",

Many past events have faded as time went on, and can never again be recovered, but there are a few insignificant bits and pieces that can still be retrieved from the corners of her memory. There are still certain childish parts to her adult self. In the past, because of her constraints and to stay out of the reporters' sight, she could only keep those urges hidden deep in her heart, but now...\n'Um... Er...' Nearl the Radiant Knight did not have the words to express everything going through her mind when she saw the dream-like palace built of a variety of dolls in the corner of the dormitory. On the other hand, the master of the palace welcomed her dumbfounded guest with a smile that embodied her satisfaction and joy.\nIt was no surprise that the knight was so flabbergasted. In that realm, there was a green patch of grass and a lake painted onto the carpet. The half-open cabinets in the corner of the wall formed a mountain range and a castle. There was a warm, gentle glow emanating from the light hanging above, with everything surrounded on all sides by dust covers.\nWild, woolen beasts of all kinds fed on the ground, paying no heed to the humans toiling nearby. The tin sentinels held their long spears tight in their hands. The silver princess ran barefoot in the field of grass.\nThe knight was about to say something, only for the master of this tiny realm to press a button and the castle in the cabinet began to change shape, revealing even more eccentric scenes: the Gesatzswächter trimming vines with a pair of shears in his hands, the blindfolded lady playing a foreign instrument with ease, the poet embracing his wife and lounging on a chair, and a finely-crafted model of what appeared to be a sword or a spear laid sound asleep in the wool by their feet...\nStill unable to recover from her shock, the knight thought carefully about the pile of dolls. Especially the woolen one with the Nearl family crest in the corner. Aside from giving her old friend an embarrassed smile, the knight could not think of what else to do...\nThis sudden, minor farce did not last for long. After a simple round of teasing, the knight obtained the records she had wanted from her friend: inside were the complete sequence of events Viviana had compiled from her recollections. With all the matters she had to attend to dealt with, the two's meeting aboard Rhodes Island came to a close for the time being. Before she departed though, Margaret suddenly had a question. She had seen herself among the puppets, yet their master herself was nowhere to be seen among them.\nThe master did not give her an answer. She simply smiled and flipped another switch. The 'sun' slowly turned and revealed the secret hidden inside—\nA young 'Master' slept curled up within, but her two antlers were already interwoven with light, illuminating the entire room.",

      "desc": "Multiple people have opined to me at length about what they think of Nova Knightclub's 'plans', how my 'vacation' might signal the Knightclub's future decisions, and so on and so forth. Still, as the Grand Knight Territory and its ghastly white glowing metal walls faded beyond the horizon, all those speculations lost their meaning.\nIn my mind, I was simply being sent to yet another place not of my choosing. The silver lining, at least, is that I don't hate it here. Every morning in Ognisko, all the workshops fire up their furnaces at almost the same time, and the blacksmiths all hail each other good morning over the clamor of fire and metal. It's an organic, living noise that pays no heed to what outsiders bring or take away.\nI took up assistant duties in an arms workshop to stave off the boredom. Orders are always coming in from Kawalerielki, with plenty of familiar names attached. Nova is now raising a 'Moonlight Knight' who uses a sword made of fluid alloy—I only later found out they swapped those red wine baths and handsome manservants for moonlight hammocks and silver-furred manglerbeast sidekicks. In contrast, the blacksmith at my workshop never asks which knight she's forging for, nor does she care who I am—be it the Candle Knight or a commoner—and isn't concerned whether her weapons go to competition knights or barren mercenaries. She never reads the 'knight persona' briefing attached to any of her orders.\nBut she does care about her craft. Sometimes, I'll stop and admire the fire in the hearth, and she'll proudly recount the tale of how the first fire came from the heavens. It fell to the land in its divinity, and where it fell the land was blessed with metal, and thus the craft of smelting and forging was born. 'Shame,' she said once, 'that nobody believes any of it now.'\nI told her that when I was very young, I saw fire falling from the heavens. She listened, and then she laughed, sensing how cursory my words were, how I was trying to save her from embarrassment. Changing the subject, she asked if I'd like to raise the ceiling's workshop a little, so I wouldn't have to walk everywhere stooped over. I declined, and she said no more.\nAs if by coincidence, on my second day, a radio program came on with an astronomical report, forecasting a meteor over Ognisko. After all the furnaces in town went out that night, the blacksmith and I stood by the workshop door, and saw blue ripples across the sky. According to an old folksong, those are made as the meteors stir the starpod, though this meteor remained hidden behind the hills.\nThe blacksmith's eyes were all aglow. Her feet set in motion, as if to chase that blazing light.\nAfter running some distance, she turned to look back at me.\n'Aren't you coming?'\n'I'm fine watching from here. The ripples its tail leaves in the sky are beautiful, too.'\nI did lie, in a way, when I told her I'd seen fire falling to the ground as a child. It was true a meteor crossed Sturmland's skies, but only the window on the wrong side was opened in my room. I didn't want to wake Father and beg him to take me outside. I never saw a meteor that evening, and so instead I clutched my ice-cold binoculars and told myself, 'It's fine. The ripples its tail leaves in the sky are beautiful, too.'\nAnd no, I was never in denial about just how achingly stunning the blazing glint of the meteor itself could be. I just never spoke of it. Just as every time I light a candle, I see only the shadow beneath it.\nThe blacksmith vanished into the night. I looked all around, and saw the burdenbeast tethered by the workshop door. In all the knight novels, Kuranta knights could cross entire prairies on their own two feet, never in need of a steed. <i>But I am no Kuranta, and right now, no knight either</i>—This thought crossed my mind as I mounted the burdenbeast and rode off, chasing where the meteor had vanished.",
