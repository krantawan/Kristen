She could've become a scholar and stayed with her alma mater, or succeeded her mother's furniture store, but Hildegard at the tender age of ten chose to join Landen Monastery, becoming one of the honored Landen Guard, devoting her own due power to the defense of Laterano.\nArchetto's archery skills come from her father, an ordinary Victorian hunter. Come fall and through winter, if safety held, he would take Hildegard out of the city, to the great snowcapped mountains. As Hildegard learned the arrow, she displayed incomparable talent, which would serve as a foundation for her outstanding displays at Landen Monastery in the future.\nHowever, every time life at the monastery comes up, the cheery and earnest Archetto takes up a begrudging look. Whether the lax elders or the ever-snoozing Landen bishopry, it seems Landen Monastery is a peerlessly undisciplined, carefree place. 'If there weren't a sign on it, you could call it a nursing home and I'd believe you,' so Archetto laments. Though by the looks of it, she truly did enjoy her time back there.",

No matter their financial issues, they still uphold a soldier's basic virtues.\nOf course, we can't forget their Landen Monastery-exclusive secret recipe cystymilk bread either, of which Archetto repeatedly sings the praises. Maybe it's the soil and the feed that give Landen Monastery's cystybeasts such voluminous builds, with milk nothing like the oily, throat-parching stuff from Ursus breeds. They use this cystymilk to make cheese, and pour it over the bread after melting it, producing the exquisite, second-to-none taste of a monastery's special cystymilk bread.\nBeyond that, the monastery also has an in-house brewery. Their beer, with malt concentrations to beat them all, has a distinct aroma, once welcomed by aristocrats lucky enough to sample it. In the early days, the Landen bishopry had no interest in any industrial pipeline for the monastery to scale up production of the beer, it spread only by word of mouth amongst nobles and religious figures, but come Landen Monastery's economic winter, plenty of voices rose up inside. A young bishop declared: 'In all honesty, I don't care whether we make the tradition a commodity, or we don't. But taking faith and peddling it—that deserves our wholehearted resistance.'\nWhen a monastery fully becomes a mercenary organization, a pasture and a brewhouse all at once, it can be bewildering. Nevertheless, seeing how proud Archetto looks as she markets those goods, surely Laterano's a fine enough place.",

Some suggestions came from the easy-going young Landen bishopry. By the end, even 'it can catapult' had made it in, and it was a weapon far beyond the realm of arrows at first glance. However, no matter what it was now, it couldn't fall short with Archetto's excellent firing technique working it. These came from Archetto's childhood winters, when her father would take her to the great snowcapped mountains. He taught her how to hunt, how to draw a bow, how to aim.\nThat said, relying only on a bow and arrow to rejuvenate a monastery would be utter nonsense. Once she left Laterano, Miss Archetto fumbled her way through the bishopry's remaining contacts, one by one visiting a great many cities, signing just as many deals. But Archetto knew deep down the Monastery was hardly an industrial plant, and these business deals hither and thither would less change the Monastery's current condition than it would take the Monastery's growth somewhere strange. Aiming to find the Monastery a true foundation for long-term collaboration, using any means she cares for, Archetto still strives to this day.\nOf course, 'almost took a wrong path' describes more than the Monastery, but for now, let's not look too hard into that time someone nearly induced Archetto to become an intercity net idol.",

The greatest difference between the Monastery and the Notarial Hall, or any other Laterano institution—the Monastery actively accept believers from beyond Laterano, and will offer them the chance to serve the Apostle.\nTime was, the Monastery adopted more of an employer model, receiving the devotion of pious warriors; back then, they earned the moniker 'Landen Guard.' However, as times changed, the Landen Guard began facing all sorts of problems with their employment framework. With a certain bishop's backing, the Monastery presided over the establishment of a complete educational system, further trialing the admission of a few youths to study at the Monastery. After that, the bishop also suggested that 'the Monastery ought to become a buoy of our faith,' and advocated admission of persons beyond Laterano. After that, some bishopry even suggested that 'justice is as faith,' and that Landen Monastery needn't be confined to the security and guarding of large-scale religious activity, as long as they could guard their true love, their Laterano—and so Landen Monastery appeared across every corner of the world.\n'History pushes for Landen Monastery's progress. In other words, we struggle and struggle so as to avoid becoming a relic. Really, we've just been more and more unable to find work, and we've had to expand business, and that's all, isn't it?'",

Inside was a small handful of the season's grains.\nIt was a tiny tradition of Landen Monastery's. Hildegard had seen her seniors off to far away lands with much the same thing. The clerics would pick out the best of the monastery's wheat, thresh it with great prudence, then dry the grains and place them into a hand-sewn pouch. They held within them Landen Monastery's fine character and glorious mission. It was said they blessed the Landen Guard in times of tribulation.\nHildegard and her senior clerics had discussed this legend's origins more than a few times. Some held that the grains could serve as emergency rations when in desperate straits, but others held their own views. Legend also told of a great Landen soldier who used the wheat he carried on his journey to brew a batch of beer, and brought a safe source of hydration and protracted merriment to villagers whose water had been polluted.\nAll told, wheat was a wonderful thing. Bread and drink, more often than not, came from it. It symbolized an enduring hope. Whether the people longed for luscious joy or a peaceful life, they would find it in these grains.\nHildegard had always held the same, too, until she passed through an ancient battlefield on her journey. The Landen Guard had faced the enemy on it some centuries ago, and she'd once read how bitter, how fierce the campaign was. She'd thought it'd be a wasteland covered by the stench of grief.\nBut no, it was now a field of wheat.\nThough a field of wheat, it seemed altogether inappropriate. The wheat growing here had no farmer to tend it. It sprang high over the plains, filling her view. It was the harvest season, and the golden ears glittered brightly in the downing sun.\nHildegard gripped the pouch in her hands. She understood. This field was born from the blessing she held in the heart of her hand. It had been nourished by blood.\nShe suddenly recalled the pet name the clerics of Landen Monastery gave these pouches. 'Seeds of Tomorrow.'\nHow would tomorrow turn out? Nobody knew. Maybe the same as ever, or maybe stained in tears of blood. But with these seeds in hand, there would be beauty in the end, sprouting from whatever became of them, even if it was watered by hardship.\nHildegard carefully stowed away the pouch of tomorrow's seeds, to grow again one day.",

      "desc": "During her years of wandering, Hildegard had visited many cities across Terra and witnessed all manner of wonders. One day, she happened across a small village near Ursus, which was almost completely isolated from the outside world. The residents here had never cared about things like faith or future, working tirelessly only to fill their stomachs. But in this village, there was a young girl who knew the history of the Landen Guard and remembered the teachings of the Lateran Pope, as her grandfather had fought alongside the Landen Guard in his younger days. Although these experiences had long since turned to old memories, and the old memories simplified into bedtime stories for a little girl, their power to promote belief in salvation had not waned. In the eyes of the little girl, Hildegard's arrival fulfilled the promise of salvation in the teachings and prophecies. So, during that harsh winter, as the little girl lay dying, she implored Hildegard to give her a Lateran funeral, using her one and only precious glass bead as payment.\n\nHildegard prayed quietly for the girl, according to the teachings of the Lateran:\n'When this land disappears, so too desire disappears. But those who serve the will and purpose shall have eternal life.'\n\nSince embarking on her journey, Hildegard has been collecting stories, artifacts, and legends left by the Landen Monastery and Guard, organizing them into a notebook. It contains an old medal purchased from a destitute wanderer, a strange Sarkaz bedtime story about the Landen Guard, and even a review of cystymilk bread by a famous food critic from the Yan.\n\n'Like in a certain story my father told me when I was little, no matter how far you wander in the forest, even if you lose your way, as long as you follow the breadcrumb trail you left behind, you can always find your way home.'\n\n'But in the story, aren't the breadcrumbs eaten by a fowlbeast, leaving the boy lost in the forest forever?'\n\n'Uh... Anyway, what I mean is that as long as those who need it hold on to faith, the story will survive alongside drinking and merriment. No matter how far you've wandered, Landen Monastery will always be there if you are willing to look back. It's all worth commemorating.'\n\nThis is where Hildegard's optimism comes from. Although she has imagined several possibilities for the future of Landen Monastery, whether it is forced to close due to poor management or destroyed in the chaos of Terra, the greatest challenge is that the ideals and functions the monastery represents are no longer needed by the people, or even the Lateran. But despite such worries, and despite disappointment and setbacks time and time again, she has never stopped.\n\nThe teachings of the Lateran tell us what we see is not that which we see, it is what we do not see. It is the unseen that is eternal.\n\n'Of course, I think if we compiled the collected stories and legends about Landen Monastery into a book, we just might be able to... raise some more money!'",
