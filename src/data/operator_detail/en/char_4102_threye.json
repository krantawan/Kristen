            "storyText": "Historical records have always left the Sarkaz tribe of the Cyclopes shrouded in mystery. In modern times, some even believe their deeds to be nothing more than myths or legends, tall tales born from misunderstandings. With the exception of the memories passed down through the Sarkaz, the last written record of the Cyclopes in the nations of Terra appeared about a hundred and ten years ago. Afterward, they disappeared completely from the public eye. Even though Rhodes Island knew that the Cyclopes had foretold the firestorm that would engulf Londinium, none of them were witnessed appearing during the conflict itself.\nWhich is why when Valarqvin took the initiative to reach out to Rhodes Island and even expressed her desire to work together, the news was met with astonishment even by Sarkaz familiar with the Cyclopes. Astonishment, but also deep concern. Curiosity and joy were the furthest things from anyone's minds.\nWhat the legends say about the Cyclopes have largely proven true—they can indeed foresee the future, and what they see are usually visions of doom.\n\n[Classified Log]\nWhat we witnessed in Chernobog can to some extent elucidate the true nature of the Cyclopes' visions. Either through perceptions incongruous with reality, or through collective emotions brought about by currently unfolding events, certain large-scale prophecies will course through the entire long history of the Sarkaz lineage, and sometimes cause history itself to converge around them. This has given the Cyclopes a terrible reputation even among the Sarkaz. However, the reality is that is not what a Cyclops sees.\nAlthough their foresight does fall within the scope of Originium Arts, a more accurate description would be an 'innate sensitivity' rather than an active use of 'Arts.' It is in essence still a comprehensive deduction derived from the collective memory of the Sarkaz, but the cognitive tendencies shaped by the race's long suffering may be why the Cyclopes tend only to foresee miserable fates. However, an overwhelming majority of their visions are arbitrary, fleeting, fragmented, chaotic, and illogical. The Arts they spend a lifetime mastering are simply a means to interpret them.\nDo their prophecies always come true?\nEven if they have, one after another, my opinion has not changed since Chernobog.",

            "storyText": "Valarqvin's purpose is extremely clear: to combat the threat looming before Sami, she is willing to cooperate with anyone who can spare concern for the country and the endless icefields.\nBecause her behavior is quite inconsistent with the impression given by the normally reclusive Cyclopes, Rhodes Island carefully inquired into her past experiences cooperating with others, as well as her recent actions before making contact with us. What she told us was astonishing, and her vast knowledge of the outside lands was enough to prove that it was not entirely fabricated. Over the last decade, she has been all across the wilderness. She has worked with Columbian scientific expedition teams as a guide, joined Yan's Tianshi in the icefields to exchange what information they had gleaned about the demons, and even managed to lure an Ursine army to the site of an attack out of concern for the vile contamination encroaching on their borders...\nHowever, her narration suddenly ended there. Next, before the Rhodes Island operator could respond, she wrapped things up on her own: 'I admit, the way I have used others in the past has not always been as respectful as my current request for cooperation with Rhodes Island. Please forgive me, as fate will show no mercy.'\nNeedless to say, the ideals of the Cyclopes as well as their code of conduct have drawn her much criticism, but the people most at odds with her are her closest neighbors, the Elafia of Sami, who find her violation of said code most objectionable. In Sami, the Cyclopes living in seclusion in the Wintertooth Mountains are treated much like any other tribe, peacefully following their own traditions while still a part of Sami culture. However, as the rifts in opinion among the various Sami tribes have become more and more apparent in recent years, it has become increasingly difficult for people to stomach the interference of the Cyclopes. The Sami warriors have immense pride in their duty of protecting the northern front; they do not trust outsiders, nor do they believe that their duty—passed down from generation to generation—needs to be shared with anyone else. They also understand the Cyclopes, and know that what drives Valarqvin to reach out to everyone cannot be a good omen.\nWe should always keep in mind that this solemn and sincere messenger of fate may well be hiding something from us. Her true nature may be that of a madwoman, an opportunist, or someone harboring the resentment of the Sarkaz and seeking vengeance. But even so, she truly is trying to draw more eyes towards the northern icefields, hoping to muster enough forces to cross that chasm, and Rhodes Island happens to share her vision in that regard. That alone is sufficient basis for cooperation.",

Almost every Cyclops has challenged the fate they foresaw, and tried to prevent some disaster or death only to discover in the end that their own actions contributed to it, or ushered it in sooner. As a result, it has become a tacit rule among the Cyclopes to avoid interfering with anything outside and instead focus on what they need to do internally as a people.\nAs for the young Cyclops Valarqvin, she was only fulfilling the duty entrusted to her by fate that day, tracking the traces left by the demons upon the frozen soil. The Cyclopes have been observing and fighting this threat for a long time: cleaning up ruins, controlling the spread of contamination, and preventing innocent people and beasts from falling prey. Those were the things within her power.\nBut she saw a survivor, seriously wounded by a demon and on the verge of transforming.\nWhat she saw was not guided by fate. She had never seen that child before then, and after that moment, decided that she would not stand by and look on any longer.\nShe risked bringing the Sarkaz girl back to her cave. As a Cyclops who had fought against the demons for a long time, she had some skill at using necrotic Arts to absorb energy and prevent the spread of contamination, but that method was but dressing a wound, and difficult to use on a seriously injured child at death's door. If judged through the fates of the countless people seen in her complex visions, the chance to survive for a girl unfortunate enough to have caught the demons' gaze was almost zero, not to mention she was still clinging onto a contaminated weapon as if fused with it. Valarqvin simply stayed by the girl's side, taking care of her, waiting for the moment she became completely contaminated, and secretly vowing that she would not eliminate the threat before then.\nShe kept thinking of the child's determination despite her instinctive fear. It was as if she still wanted to fight back, unwilling to cower to any foe, even the demons.\nAfter an unknown amount of time, fate revealed its answer, and the child woke up. Valarqvin knew that she would be unable to care for her like a parent; the girl ought to be free, and should break free from all shackles including those of her inevitable fate, just as she broke free from the demonic transfiguration. Valarqvin, alone, would remain in fate's cage. As she thought this to herself, she turned her back on the girl, and walked towards the ever-shifting icefield beyond the cave.\nAlthough Valarqvin would later avoid making any predictions about Typhon's future, did she really see nothing at all when she decided to save her?\nIndeed, she has seen a great many sights and possibilities. And she will forever remain silent about them.",

            "storyText": "[Classified Log]\nThe Cyclopes' northward migration was not a large-scale movement widely observed and recorded in the annals of history. However, the Sarkaz know that it began even before the Terran Era. Over the following millennia, the reclusive and solitary Cyclopes slowly moved north one by one, disappearing from everyone's sight. Only a few historical fragments can, when put together, reveal a common thread for this migration. Of course, the Sarkaz Royal Court never truly lost sight of this branch, though they also knew that Kazdel would not be built for them. The Cyclopes' attention had long since shifted away from the fate of the Sarkaz race, to instead focus on the endless icefields. Perhaps as early as thousands of years ago, they had already foreseen the doom lurking in the icefields' depths.\nThe Cyclopes have a code of silence not to disclose a doomsday prophecy to outsiders, even after thousands of years. So I can only speculate based on historical facts recorded in ancient texts that such prophecies are indeed possible, because the last distinctly identified Lord of the Cyclops Court was also a King of the Sarkaz who had accepted the Black Crown. And the time of her succession was close to the beginning of the Cyclopes' northward migration.\nSome ancient texts claim that their departure was due to disillusionment with the other Sarkaz, a reasonable conclusion given that the Cyclops King of that era was assassinated. However, for an individual who can traverse the memories of all Sarkaz souls, how could a monarch able to foresee all manner of tragic fates fall prey to a mere assassination? And no matter how many different interpretations come from the multivarious records, they all ultimately emphasize that 'she accepted her death peacefully.'\n......\nThe Cyclopes find the power of words to be taboo, but history must be recorded accurately.\nFor a fellow Sarkaz who wishes to embrace change, I would like to show my respect.\n––Logos",

None of that could possibly be true.\nShe'd heard people were racketeering as pretend-Sami in the scenic parts where the Columbians parked themselves. Still, she didn't think she'd run into one on her very first time here.\nShe thinks to step up and put a stop to it, but as it happens, a crowd's commotion beats her to the punch.\nA ne'er-do-well slips out from it, making to rob the trader of the crystal, who struggles to resist but only succeeds in pissing the assailant off. An edged weapon is thrust directly at the trader's chest, and the crowd all flinches and shuts their eyes out of fear.\nAnd yet... with a 'thunk', the blade bounces off. Shocked, Arges catches sight of a crystal tumble out from the gash in the trader's shirt. The trader swiftly disarms the assailant of their weapon in that moment of confusion, and in an instant has the would-be killer subdued.\n'It was the crystal! The crystal saved me!', the trader yells with blood still hot. 'Listen to me, these crystals bring good luck!' The words bring Arges's own mission to mind, and a thought quickly strikes.\nThis may well be a lucky coincidence, but... if such little moments of luck continue to accumulate, who's to say what colossal strength they could ultimately embody?\nWith that thought in mind, she strides over.\n......\n'So... that's why you bought all these crystals?'\n'Yes.'\n'Even though you know they're just ordinary crystals?'\n'...They're very pretty, and with just a little touching-up, I can make light sources out of them too.'\n'...Alright. A Cyclops who can predict the future bought a bunch of lucky crystals... You know, I think even Amma would laugh if she heard that.'"
