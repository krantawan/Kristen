Or maybe because of a general revulsion for Infected people, the lower level functionaries of these companies may not have an interest in caring for them, no matter what policies the upper management may put in place to keep people working.\nWhether April was forced out of Rim Billiton because her benefits weren't worth the paper they were printed on, or because a bad actor worked against her, we can't know. And it's clear she hasn't investigated it herself. Of course, it doesn't really matter, in the end.

In fact, Rhodes Island encourages them to do just that, in hopes of improving their lives. So while most operators live in very plain surroundings, there are some with a lot of character, and April's are among the best. \nHer room is exquisitely decorated.

Sudden changes are always difficult to accept. One who does try to accept such changes should be commended for her open-mindedness. But we shouldn't condemn someone for failing to accept the drastic, sudden change that is Oripathy infection.\nNot everyone would openly accept her identity as an Infected person, and every new Rhodes Island operator will receive psychological counseling about that identity to avoid excessive burdens and conflicts over the course of her work. \nThis is of particular concern for operators who come from civilian backgrounds like April, for whom discrimination against the Infected is deeply rooted. We must acknowledge the reality that some people, completely without malice, grow up in an environment that teaches them to dehumanize the Infected. And that these people, even if they become Infected themselves, do not see the Infected as peers. It is difficult to reverse that perception. \nLuckily, April's cheerful disposition and open-minded personality did her well. While she had some ingrained discrimination against the Infected and some resultant self-loathing, she quickly shed these ideas thanks to our counseling and the general environment of life in Rhodes Island. She immediately began to think about how she could help others who also suffered like her. While she may not be that impressive in combat, April's outlook and thinking are worthy of emulation.",

The vast streets can be seen from the roof of this building, as well as the spotlights shone skyward from the gym several blocks out. Unlike Rim Billiton, there's no stench of slag on the evening breeze, nor the dust Rhodes Island so often faces in storms while sailing the wilds. It's clean, and strange for it.\nHer field mission concluded two hours ago. She made sure to put on her favorite band's bracelet as she set out from the Rhodes office. Had a whole disguise on and everything. Still got stopped outside the venue. 'Our tickets aren't for sale to the Infected. We need to ensure the safety of our other concertgoers,' the worker said, while taking a cautious step back. 'Sorry.'\n<i>Yeah, figures I'd get caught,</i> she ruefully thinks, stood below the looming white gymnasium walls. Infected have their own neighborhoods, their own perimeter walls, and their own checkpoints. Rhodes Island spent a week of classes teaching her that Oripathy wasn't something you could transmit just by brushing past someone else, but it's not like she can teach the whole city that.\nOh well. She's on the roof, right here, right now. She takes off her headphones.\nRhythmic cheers and shrieks pour out of the circular venue, indistinct by the time they reach her ears. They're a lot like the calls she used to hear from the mines. In this moment, they echo the beat of her heart. She reaches a hand out towards the spotlights in the sky, almost able to feel the air shaking. Even though that concert venue all bedazzled with lights feels as far away as the moon.\nIn that sea of noise, an extremely familiar intro faintly reaches her, every note mixed in with the city's clamor.\nShe needs to be careful. She can't get spotted. But she still waves her braceleted hand in time with the music, lightly singing as she does.\n<i>So lucky I got to apply for this field mission, seriously,</i> she thinks."
