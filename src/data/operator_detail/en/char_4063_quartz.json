Most of the time, they're just normal folks who had no choice but to take up this line of work. In fact, if at all possible, many mercenary teams will try to avoid direct confrontation and bloodshed with other teams. After all, people just trying to earn a living have no desire to give up their lives for their work. Similarly, Quartz most likely chose her weapon for its intimidating appearance, in hopes of avoiding any unnecessary trouble. That said, the greatsword is definitely not just for show. The destructiveness she demonstrated in her tests would no doubt quickly sober up anyone getting any funny ideas.'",

But it never told me if it was a holiday, or my birthday, or if I should be taking some time off...'\n\n'One night, I came home from work to find my mother sound asleep. At that moment, I was suddenly hit by the thought that I didn't know if everything I'd been doing was because I loved my mother, because of the promise I'd made to my father, or if I'd just gotten used to that kind of regularity. Even after my mother died, life with the Pioneer Team was more of the same. About the only difference was how they'd change your schedule around on a dime. But just like the clockwork in this pocket watch, it just felt like someone had wound it up so it'd keep on ticking, endlessly.'\n\n'I guess... it was probably the time I left the Pioneer Team?

It'll be a cakewalk.'\n'I told you, give me an exact time. That's how every mission should be handled. Or do you plan to come back hungry with no dinner ready?'\n'Alright, fine. He'll be there at 7:00 p.m., to meet someone else.'\nQuartz finishes cleaning her greatsword and opens a toolkit she'd bought from the town's clockmaker, then starts repairing the pocket watch she'd left on the dining table.\n'Thirteen seconds slow,' she says with a sigh.\nThat evening.\nCarrying her greatsword, Quartz pushes open the bar's doors.\nIn the only place in town worthy of being called entertainment, people were lost in wild revelry. Through the haze of alcohol vapors and clouds of smoke, she spots the target—crouched in the corner, clutching his glass tightly.\nShe steps over the drunk patrons sprawled on the floor and sits across from him.\n'Miss, can I get you a drink?'\n'No, thank you. I'm here waiting for someone—7:00, right?'\nThe target stares intently at her, this strange woman who had unexpectedly started talking to him. Swallowing hard, he suddenly pulls a remote from his bag and shouts:\n'You vermin couldn't make it in a nomadic city! And now you're out here in the wasteland, to make my life as miserable as yours! The moment the clock hits 7:00, the Originium powder bomb under this table will blow you sky-high! This is what mercs like you deserve!'\nSeven...\nThe music cuts off abruptly. The revelers freeze in their tracks, turning to look beneath the table where a blurred red countdown clock was flashing.\nSix...\nThe bar's doors fly open, followed by the windows, as those who are still sober drag their unconscious companions out of the building.\n'One!' The target shouts, jumping onto the bar and raising his arms as if welcoming a grand finale.\n'Sir, your watch is ten seconds fast.'\nQuartz lets out a long sigh, raises her greatsword, and brings it down on him.\nPeople watch as a young woman carrying a greatsword hauls a man out of the now-empty bar.\nFive seconds later, the bar explodes, sending wood and glass shards soaring, and bursting into a dazzling firework against the night sky.\n'Where are you going?'\n'To find some cold water to wake him up. Then, to thank my watch repair toolkit.'"
