When speaking is required of her, she is smooth and evasive, and reveals very little of her actual thinking. She has also been admonished for repeatedly spacing out during meetings. According to the results of her current observation, it is only when discussing technology and machinery with Vulcan, Mayer, and Closure that Glaucus expresses her opinions with any enthusiasm.

Even in a special ecological environment such as the Ægir Region, incidence of such hereditary disease is rare and there is currently no treatment available.\nHowever she does not seem dispirited by her situation. On the contrary, her passion for technology seems to come from the exoskeletal equipment designed to help her overcome these hardships.\nSomething worth mentioning is that Glaucus was born with antibodies that fight against irritants and poisons. Apart from conventional poisons, nerve paralyzers and hallucinogens are essentially ineffective. Glaucus is eager to accompany the medics' research. To put it more precisely, she pretends to understand what they're saying and nods along. Sometimes they are concerned whether she is even really following along with what they're saying...",

Even more rarely does she leave her room.\nIn short, she is a somewhat dull and awkward child who prefers silently doing her own things.\n\nAs a result, I believe that the allegation that Glaucus and her relatives are involved in a secret heretical organization in the Ægir Region is not related to her current operational performance.

Afterawards, it was discovered that this weapon's high frequency electromagnetic spectrum capabilities could not be controlled. The first thing that was damaged was the communications device in the user's own pocket. As a result, it was abandoned. It was Glaucus who took a look at it during an overhaul of her exoskeletal equipment and took it back to Rhodes Island for a very low price. Unexpectedly, after some modifications performed by Glaucus, it was able to inflict powerful destructive power against enemy machines. However, it also damaged a large amount of our own equipment. Is this why Silence and Mayer suggested that Glaucus should work on her own?\n\nWhether this operator can shoulder the burden of individual missions is judged solely on objective conditions and must never be mixed with personal factors.\n——Kal'tsit",

She imagines it'll just enable her to walk a bit faster, stand a bit longer, give her a few more days in her life of feeling the sensation of the ground with her own two legs.\nShe's not all too clear on what kind of change it can bring into her life, but she's sure it beats a wheelchair, and it'll give her a bare minimum sort of comfort during the times she can use it—she'd like to be able to stand as long as she wishes, after all.\nFraction by fraction, she installs the exoskeleton around her legs. The ice-cold metal presses against her skin, and the straps bind her weakened leg muscles tight. She gives lifting one leg a try, against the heavy frame has her all the more unable to move her feet.\nShe's spent so long unable to run now.\n'Is this really going to do anything?'\nGlaucus whispers to herself. She's not sure; she's never touched this sort of technology before.\nA few years ago, when Glaucus learned her leg muscle atrophy was caused by a hereditary disease in her family, she still had hopes she'd be lucky, thinking how maybe it could be cured, that it was only serious for a tiny fraction of her family, and she wouldn't be so unfortunate.\nYet as the days went by, Glaucus realized nothing could prevent the gradual loss of strength in her legs, and all she could do was talk herself into accepting this, how it was bound to happen to her body sooner or later.\nBut today, abruptly, with an unwavering power, the exoskeleton braces her body. Hurriedly, Glaucus seizes on this force and stands up, nervousness overcoming her, the bloodrush as her heart violently pounds causing her to take a tiny step forward.\nThen comes a second.\nA third.\nA fourth.\nGlaucus walks through the door, this physically choking emotion surging through her head, squeezing all her reason out. She has a sudden urge to run that defies everything. Even though she still hasn't gotten a hold of her balance, she feels she's gotten a miraculous hold of everything.\nThe metal is ice-cold, steel-solid, and it braces her frail legs. She runs like the wind, runs for the endless world outside.",
