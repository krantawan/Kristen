Incandescence, Andreana and their respective families left Iberia together to settle in Rim Billiton. The two submitted their resumes to Rhodes Island not long after. \nAs for why they brought their families, Andreana appears troubled when posed with the question. She insisted on learning to shoot, despite her family's objections. That troubled their relationship and she ran away from home, where she met Incandescence. But in the end, family ties are tough to break. The two families ultimately made contact and agreed to leave Iberia as a group.",

Particularly the gun she is never seen without. \nWhen she first joined Rhodes Island, her weapon perplexed many of our operators who were familiar with guns— Questions such as: 'She's a Lateranan who looks like an Iberian?' 'Did she rob a Lateranan? Such a badass?' 'Iberians can use guns too?' swirled around endlessly. After all, Blacksteel's guns are assumed to be some kind of corporate secret, but a non-Laterano freelance mercenary strutting around with a huge gun gets people talking. \nOf course, everything becomes clear once you see her shoot an inkball out of that thing. Apparently, it's a modified crossbow made to look like a gun. Because Andreana is a committed firearms enthusiast. \nAccording to her, Laterano culture has had a strong influence on the Iberians, who often display an affection for it. After seeing one of the statues in church as a child, Andreana fell in love with the weapons, and devoted herself to mechanical engineering in hopes of making a crossbow in the style of a gun, since she lacks the affinity for Originium Arts necessary to use a real one herself. \nBut there is a point here worth examining, and one Andreana herself did not realize. She mentioned that she was dragged into court over the weapon several times, only to be chastised when it became clear it was not a real gun. That seems reasonable. But with the limited information we have, the Iberian courts should be very powerful. And for such an organization to grab her 'several times' for something known to be harmless the first time indicates that they may have been using it as a pretense to find something else. \nHowever, since we lack reliable intelligence about the internal politics of a country closed so long to outsiders, we are not able to form any concrete judgments about the situation. And since, at least according to Andreana herself, she has not been harmed or unnecessarily interrogated, we leave the matter to speculation.",

Or at least that the benefits of them joining us would outweigh the potential harm. Otherwise, they would have been found inadmissible. \nAs for me, I don't know what the story is. Haha, Kal'tsit actually said it would be okay to tell me, but I refused. Knowing too much can get you in trouble. I'll leave this one to Kal'tsit.\nWhat I took from her is that the difference between Andreana on one side and Specter and Skadi on the other is something like that between a drop of ink into clear water and a proper inkwell. The drop of ink is itself an infringement on the dignity of life, to the point that Kal'tsit expressed clear disdain for it: 'There are those who have reached their hands into places they do not belong.

At this level, we can't compare her to Skadi's physique at all.' While there is some ambiguity in that statement, it is true that when compared to Skadi, Andreana's physical prowess could well be explained by better physical development. There are always those who are naturally strong. Let's just say that making her a Sniper Operator may be a bit beneath her. But Rhodes Island won't interfere with her personal choice. \nAll in all, after confirming no anomalies in her physical condition, the matter has been closed.

      "desc": "After the regular checkup, Dr. Gavial wanted to take me out drinking, and I turned her down. It's not that I don't like her or anything; I think she's a fine person. I just don't like things that are a pain in the ass. \nIt's noisy as hell, there's alcohol, wrist wrestling, and inevitably, a little girl named Tomimi always shows up... Any single one of these things in isolation, I can probably deal with. Some, I might even call cute, but when you smash everything together, that's what you call a pain in the ass. I much prefer enjoying a glass of juice alone on the deck to spending a night at the bar. \n\nI'm almost out of juice. \nOne nice thing about being alone is that it's comfy. One not-so-nice thing is the fact that you get bored easily. \nI open up my toolbox with the mod kit and start to do maintenance on my 'gun.' Guess it's one form of entertainment. \nTwenty seconds, it's completely disassembled. \nEighty-one seconds, every part's squeaky clean. \nThirty-five seconds, the lubricant on all the metal parts has been replaced. \nFifteen seconds, the reassembly is complete. \nIf the thing in my hand was the real deal, I'd be able to do a whole lot more with the mod kit. Unfortunately, it's just a weirdly-shaped crossbow that fires a special ink bullet. Doesn't actually use Originium or anything sensational like that. \nSome things only work in the right hands. Trying to force them onto others won't end well. \n\nJust as I was deciding if I wanted to get a second glass of juice, I hear a few other people step onto the deck. Other than the sound of their footsteps, they aren't making any other noises. The people wisely keep their distance from me and stop on the side of the deck. \nBefore long, I hear a soft singing voice from them. I look back, and as expected, it's a group of Abyssal Hunters. \nAs soon as I see the three of them, my heart starts to beat faster. I once told to the Doctor it was love at first sight, though of course that was a joke. In reality, my best guess was that this unusual physiological reaction was probably related to that incident when I was a child. But I've never asked about it, nor do I think about it much. Wouldn't be able to get any answers anyway, and all the thinking in the world wouldn't solve the problem. In the end, I'd just be causing extra issues for myself. \nAnd I have a hunch – it'd be a hundred times more of a pain in the ass than Gavial dragging me to a hundred bars for a hundred nights. \nSo, as long as that thing stays far, far away from my daily life, I'm good. I have no desire to throw myself headlong into something that's gonna be a pain in the ass. \nBut occasionally, every so often... \nWhen I close my eyes, I'll see that person. I have no idea who that person is, but I can tell, they're at the center of this whole mess. \nSomeone wrapped in the smell of the sea, a robed Iberian... \nI stand up and sling the gun over my shoulder, pick up the only toolbox messy enough to be my own, and go to grab my second cup of juice.",
