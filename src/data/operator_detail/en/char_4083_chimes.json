Travel-worn, but still friendly to everyone she meets.\nThe northwestern region is full of mountains with villages big and small sparsely scattered all over, unable to communicate effectively with each other unlike the villages in Jiangnan with their waterways. Even land transportation is extremely inconvenient, and Wind Chimes was born in one of those villages.\nWith her good grades, the steadfast Wind Chimes was admitted to a school in a nomadic city. However, after studying for a few years she gave up her chance of further education and returned to her hometown to work as the village's Messenger.\nYoung and strong, she trekked the mountain paths to figure out a way to make travelling between the nearby villages easier. On top of that, she also tried to open an agricultural trade route between the villages and nomadic cities, but it did not work out.\nShe had been recounting her experience in her usual frank manner up till this point where she fell silent. We assumed that high logistics costs were the main reason she had failed to achieve her goal, but that was just the most direct, yet least important reason for her plans going awry.\n'I promised the official in charge of commerce and trade that a village representative would come to the city for discussion. Then I excitedly returned to the village, but was greeted with the sight of several factory recruitment notices and a whole stack of signed recruitment contracts at the village headman's place. I looked at the signatures and they were all dated within a few days of my departure.'",

To her, it was the letters, or more precisely, the greetings, news, and emotions in them that connected those who had traveled far from their villages to their homes.\nWith such experiences and a steadfast and kindhearted personality, her setback only set her sights on a much broader and rugged place—she tried to become the regional Messenger of the entire mountainous region around her hometown.\nAfter a testing period, she quickly attained the position in an official capacity, and held a year-long record of zero missed deliveries until it was broken by a pack of hungry tuskbeasts.\nAfter returning to the city, Wind Chimes asked her colleagues for advice on how to avoid the beasts. However, before she could break her own record again, another incident happened.\nShe ran into a group of bandits.\n'I was blindfolded, and yelling at them till my voice was hoarse to leave the letters alone. The goods could be replaced, but if the letters were destroyed, the words within could never be replaced.\n'No, the bandit chief didn't laugh like the ones you see on television. He even told me somewhat sincerely that it was not possible. He didn't kill the official, but didn't leave the officers even a scrap of information, because in his line of work, he could easily lose his head from a little carelessness.'\n'I heard the sound of paper going up in flames, and I knew right then that it was time for me to buy a sword.'\nSince then, her colleagues would occasionally see fresh wounds on her, but the goods and letters she carried were never lost again.",

For those especially who do not live in a nomadic city, the compensation for helping out with the Chidao is often enough to make a considerable leap in their standard of living. Though after such a change, there comes the question on how to maintain the new status quo.\nMost settled communities often want long-term contracts with the Chidao maintenance agency, but such opportunities are rare.\nFor the more proactive people, getting a glimpse of the Chidao and the fragments of the nomadic cities they bring renders them unable to hold back their aspirations. Many young people and even those older follow the Chidao on their journey to the nomadic cities. An entire village moving to a city like in Wind Chime's case is certainly a bit extreme, but it is by no means unheard of.\nWind Chimes gets dejected at the sight of one deserted village after another, but she also understands that those people have the right to pursue a better life.\nWhat she could do, then, was to send back wanders's money and letters together to their parents, and then deliver their words as well as letters from others with huge bags of dried meat back to the city.\nAn old man was calculating his money under the light of an oil lamp, pondering over what farming equipment to purchase, what crops to grow, if he should use an entire barrel of soy sauce to pickle meat, and eventually decided to use a majority of the funds to rear some livestock; a young person was lying in bed exhausted, watching a beautiful life depicted on the television screen, subconsciously going through an entire packet of dried meat while talking to themselves with a few hints of their rusty native tongue.\nAt that moment, Wind Chimes was out in the wilderness travelling between cities. The twin moons shone overhead, the mountains stretched in all directions, and the night breeze blew through the thin clothing she had chosen to keep her journey lighter.",

However, the uproar did not concern her much and she quickly moved on after dropping off the money, for there were many more deliveries to make.\nOnly later did she learn that there was a cruel connection between the teenager she had parted on bad terms with and the baffling commotion in the village.\nShe spent an entire day watching the footage in the young man's camera: the scenery, the monologue, the interview, the little stunt of pretending the camera was off while leaving the microphone on, and the 'apology letter.'\nAfter that, Wind Chimes started bringing the camera everywhere.\nAt first, her experience was limited to filming deliveries. She is not a film enthusiast, so it was not surprising for her to assume the camera was broken because the lens cap was not on. But still, she persevered with the same tenacity she traversed the mountains with, and went from filming goods, to people, and then the roads she traveled, and the memory card soon ran out of space.\nThe more videos she shot, the more she regretted her actions back then. Naivety is not arrogance, but willful ignorance is.\nHowever, when she was asked if she wanted to sell the rights of her footage to companies, she merely laughed at the thought.\nShe knew that her work was shining a spotlight on the daily isolation and poverty of the villages, as well as the foundations of her nostalgia. She would not cut herself any slack, but did not want to publicize it either. These images were ruthless, but also extremely valuable to her.\nAs for that disturbance, none of the Rhodes Island operators involved in the incident have spoken much about it. We only found out her opinion on the matter when Wind Chimes talked about it in a conversation with others.\n'I remember it all, I'll never forget it. But that person's death... was purely an accident.'\n'If I didn't deliver the money, what else could they have done?'\n'I can't think of anything else.'",

      "desc": "'These are the only remaining towns and villages in the mountains. I've marked them on the map. Generally, you can just follow the indicated order when delivering mail. I've used different colors to mark each section; each corresponds to different road conditions and recommended modes of transportation—just a bit of advice from someone who's been doing this a while.\n'First, there's the part with the smoothest roads, where you can ride a bike. Going downhill is exhilarating, but mind your speed. No matter how good the mountain roads are, they're still bumpy; if your package gets jostled too much, it could fall apart. It'd be almost impossible to find a letter and retrieve it if you lose it in the mountains, so be careful.\n'Next is the section you'll have to cover on foot. Walking mountain paths isn't easy, but the most important thing is to race against the weather. You'll need to read the skies. When clouds gather, you should walk faster; when it darkens, you should start running. When it thunders, it'll be already too late to think about finding shelter. Traveling in the rain can be dangerous. My horn, err... I learned this the hard way. As for wild beasts or bandits, stay calm. It's no big deal. I can handle them, and if you're taking over my route, you can too.\n'Finally, there are some special paths that are rarely used—I'm running out of space, so I'll write the rest on a separate sheet. But I'll mention one here: the zip lines. Don't be afraid; I've ridden them many times. They're safe, even pleasant. You might come to enjoy them after a while.'\n...\n'Oh, and one last thing I should write here—it's a small favor. There are a few villages with hardly any young folks left, and I marked them on the map. The elders there tend to be a bit stubborn, and some aren't very mobile, so please be patient and lend a hand if you can. I thank you on their behalf. Truly.\n'I almost forgot the most important part: make sure to protect yourself against Oripathy! Don't let the...'\nThe writing stops abruptly on the back of the map, filling every inch of the small piece of paper. Wind Chimes had left it there after returning from a checkup at the doctor's. Much time has passed since then, and Wind Chimes continued to walk those mountain paths year after year, but the old map remained lying on her desk. One day, someone happened to flip it over and couldn't help but give a wry smile.\n'This girl's so naive—she really hoped someone else would be willing to deliver mail all the way up to those remote mountain villages, just like she does.'\n'I'd say when the people are all gone, there won't be any need for another Messenger anyway.'\n'(Sigh) It's been so many years, and there are so many stories on these roads; no letters could capture them all.'\n'And the road is so long... no messenger could ever walk it all.'",
