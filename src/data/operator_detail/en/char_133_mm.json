She gave a slight bow with her other hand holding out a magnifying glass before her, and then she took the measure of the villa step by step. All said and done, she lifted her head before the few people now stuck in the place.\nShe seemed somewhat nervous. Everyone could tell as much.\nThe girl took a long, deep breath and straightened her back, attempting to mask her vaguely perceptible timidity and fluster in front of all the suspects. She gripped her pipe tight, and gradually her nerves calmed.\nHer head was quite disheveled, her upwards-springing hair tied into two bunches, with red-rimmed spectacles and shining blue eyes behind them that gave a glimmering and lively gaze at the suspects before her.\n\n'Ladies and gentlemen.'\nFrom her breast pocket, the girl produced a pocket watch of fine craftsmanship, clearly exquisitely cared for throughout its years—of which it had plenty—and after checking the current time, she introduced herself thus, in an altogether too spry voice: 'Good morning, everyone. On request, I'll be the detective in charge of solving this case—'\n\nA detective!\nA faint murmur perturbed the crowd. She said she was a detective! Victoria certainly had no shortage of private detectives such as her, who took on all manner of commissions their clients were wary of entrusting to the police. Indeed, it was no unfamiliar profession.\nAnd yet...\nThis self-professed detective girl seemed simply too young!\n\n'Everyone! Hear me out, please!'\nThe tender detective surreptitiously gripped the items in her hands, then raised her voice. 'This may be the first case I've taken on—but—I ask you all to be at ease! I do have the approval of my grandfather and grandmother! I am a qualified detective!'\nShe did seem truly quite proud of the fact that her elders gave her their recognition, as her face which seemed altogether hesitant at first now gleamed bright with confidence.\nIt immediately gave her far more credible airs.\n\n'Thus, I ask you all to cooperate with my work!' said the young detective, puffing her chest out. And then with a bellow, 'I am!—this case's!—detective!'"
