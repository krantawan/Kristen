She fiercely advocated playing the sport at Rhodes Island, even going so far as to hold basic drills, lessons, and even seminars on gamesmanship. It is obvious that she is very proficient and highly experienced with the game of baseball. And yet, observation showed that Cuora possesses very little actual combat experience. With her familiarity with baseball, she has been able to grasp mission plans, objectives and strategies far easier than one would expect from an inexperienced Operator. \nAfter positive responses to Cuora's baseball presentations, she gleefully unpacked her bag and handed every Operator present a baseball. \nHold on.

In addition, the seams are sufficiently resilient that even sustained hammering cannot damage its integrity. \nAs for where she got the backpack, Cuora cheerfully replies that she doesn't remember. The investigation was halted when no lead on the weapon/item's origin could be found. \nFurther tests concluded that Cuora's baseball bat is made of the same alloy, despite being even more ordinary in appearance than the backpack. \nSo, how did the inexperienced Cuora, with her marvelous items, show up at Rhodes Island?",

Why's the sun a baseball, and why are all the clouds mitts? ...Before her sprawls the baseball field she knows so well, where she once swung her bat to her heart's content. Hmm? Someone's crying outside the field, and they've got crystals growing all over their chest, and their baseball got broke in half and they dropped it next to them.\nHello, why are you crying? Oh, I think I know you from somewhere? You're that ball player Ambrois Edwards, right? Look, I wrote your signature on my bat! But I guess I misspelled it as Edgards, heheh!\n...But he pays no attention to her, and continues to weep. The people on the field shoo them out, shouts of anger becoming baseballs pelted at them, striking against the Originium crystals on the player's body. He covers himself tightly with clothing, and gradually becomes a giant, solid, silent stone, losing all light.\nCuora puts her backpack on him, and tells the player she'll take him to Rhodes Island, where they'll be sure to turn him back to normal.\nThey climb over a hill of helmets stacked high, cross a bridge made of bats, ride a baseball through the sky—\nOnce the figure of the landship reveals itself before them, Cuora gleefully shouts, look! We're here! You can get treated here, and you won't need to be scared of getting chased off the field, and you won't have to use clothes to hide the rocks, and then they'll keep cheering your name in all cities everywhere—you're Ambrois the Invincible!\n...The player seems just as happy, and he emerges from the crumbling stone, and reaches an arm out, and waves a bat—\n\nPhew... hey! Who hit my head?!\nLava, lemme tell you about this really long dream I had! It was about... um, what was it about?\nWho cares! C'mon, the ball game's about to begin! And Mister Ambrois finally came out of retirement for this one!\n\n...In the Infected neighborhood, a few railings hem an empty lot, which the people have taken to calling a baseball field.\nCuora sees her idol. The freshly unretired player isn't hiding the crystals on his body, and the cheers drown out all other noise. She jumps and leaps in excitement.\nAbruptly, out on the field, Ambrois waves a hand at her, and steps out of the crowd to give her a light pat on the shoulders. Here in the sun, Cuora sees a smiling face.\nAt this moment, she recalls that kind of a long time ago, she was driven off the baseball field for her own Oripathy. That day, she wandered the streets from end to end, and ran across a weeping ball player.\nShe can't quite remember who it was. She can't quite remember what she said, either.\nBut the player before her right now says this to her: 'Thanks for those words of comfort you gave me, li'l missy.'",
