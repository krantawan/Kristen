With this little strength, most Terran could break free without much effort. Even I could.'\n'Look at the equipment you're using, though. It's so advanced. Like your comms. It's amazing! You don't need any Originium to power it, and it's tiny!'\nThe Engineering operator prods Tina's communications equipment with fascination.\n'Especially this solar panel! How did you make it so small? I never saw technology like this back in Columbia. It's amazing.'\n'Anyway, it might take some time to modify the equipment. You can come check on us if that sounds like your thing.'\n'Oh, right. I need a hunting bow. Can I apply for that here?'\n'A hunting bow?'\nA few hours later, the Engineering operator finds herself even more perplexed when Tina tries her best to draw a Sarkaz military-grade bowstring.\nTheir military prowess and combat techniques are extremely professional, and their equipment and tactics are beyond cutting-edge, but their physical qualities are comparatively lacking. Where are they from?\nIs it because their physiques are so imperfect that they have to make up for it with technology?\nOut of respect for everyone involved, however, the Engineering operator decides against pressing further, instead opting to keep her questions to herself."
