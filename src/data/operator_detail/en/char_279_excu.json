The third item saw the death of a Laterano citizen serving as the chief executive of a city state guard unit.

Our studies have shown that Executor's lack of empathic ability is not illustrative of psychopathic tendencies, rather it indicates a sort of mechanical absorption of information, with an overstimulated nervous system reaching similar conclusions. Adding more information to his mind does not result in the formation of secondary conceptions. \nOf course, the medical operators responsible for examination of Executor's brain activity have not yet reached a consensus. \nA small number of operators suspect that Executor is not in fact human, but rather a humanoid robot spy sent by Closure. Closure has denied such charges, but she too believes that Executor is not a human being. \nFor his part, Executor has never responded to the rumors. He just silently accepts his tasks and completes them whenever he is told 'this is a task that should be prioritized.'\nNaturally, he puts his Notarial tasks first. \nSuch is the origin of his name: he decisively eliminates all obstacles and executes the will of the Laterano citizenry.

Indeed, it is true that the Notarial Hall comprises one piece of the Laterano legal apparatus, and the executors attest to an important fact: Laterano takes its responsibility to its citizens very seriously, treating it as a binding contract. \nBut the Laterano people's adherance to the law, or even fear of it, goes behind an executor's power to instill. \nI speak not of the power of religion. The political entities founded on deeply held beliefs go beyond Laterano alone, and the uniqueness of their citizenry cannot be attributed to piety or self-discipline alone. \nThis is also not to say that executors, including Executor, are not themselves strong. Last week, I saw him tear out the aorta of a vicious beast with his bare hands, spraying his partner with blood. That was not the first time an operator came crying to me that 'Executor is terrifying,' and it certainly won't be the last. \nBut for the hands of its few lawyers, executors, wandering judges, and the Pope himself, Laterano can do little more than proclaim that the law must be followed. \nIn addition to its temporal statutes, Laterano must have another, higher order of law that we cannot perceive. Rather than saying the executor is one piece of the Laterano legal apparatus, it would be more appropriate to say that the executor is the physical manifestation that Laterano created to befit the name of the law. At least that's my opinion. \n\nAll I want to know is what Executor meant by 'the statute that takes effect once a shot is fired.' Given what he said, I have to wonder if this 'law' might be some kind of Originium Art. \nThis is the first time I have ever seen Kal'tsit at a loss for words. She appeared to have something to say, but turns and left with a cold laugh. The whole time we were discussing Laterano law, she kept a hand over her mouth and an eyebrow raised. It was really odd. \nI hope my curiosity hasn't gotten us in trouble. \n\n--Caster Operator L.A.O.",

Don't tell me you're no longer curious.'\n'Fine... I am, but this feels sketchy...'\n'Then why don't you go touch it yourself and come back and tell us what that thing on his halo is?!'\n'...Forget it. I could never do something like that, not with that poker face of his.'\n'Which is why I'm guessing it's some sort of emotional amplifier or something.'\n'Don't be ridiculous. You don't really believe people can hang things on their halo, do you?'\n'My neighbor's cousin's classmate, who works in a psych ward, said it's possible to attach things to a halo now. Some new tech.'\n'That sounds a bit dubious—I read a book on psychoanalysis the other day, and it said that your halo is shaped by your inner thoughts. If you ask me, Federico probably wants to empathize with others, but he's physically unable to, which is why his halo has a 'hearing-aid' on it.'\n'Well in that case, I think his hearing-aid needs a new battery...'\n'Oh, come on. He cares more about how many bullets are left in his gun than anyone else's feelings. I'd say that thing on his halo is an indicator showing how much ammo he has left.'\n'That <i>would</i> explain how he always knows...'\n'Nonsense. I've known—uh, been around—Federico since we were young. That thing was there even before he became an executor.'\n'Are you guys crazy? Have you ever seen anyone else hanging stuff on their halo?'\n'Alright, alright, if it's really some kind of external attachment, we'll know by looking through his bag. Captain Gianna, have you found anything?'\n'It's all pretty normal—magazines, water, and... an umbrella. So he didn't stash it in his bag?'\n'I told you it's not some weird peripheral device!'\n'He's so attached to it that he won't take it off, even when he's about to be made a Saint. Is he planning to show it to His Holiness the Pope?'\n'What is who planning to show me?'\n'Y-Your Holiness?! Has the ceremony ended? Why are you here?'\n'I should be the one asking you that question. Why are two executors and a captain of the Pontifica Cohors off duty, sneaking around here with a notary apprentice?'\n'We just wanted to know what that device on Federico's halo is for!'\n'Oh, that thing? Just think of it as a height marker.'\n'A... height marker? Your Holiness, how do you know that?'\n'Of course I know. I've been watching him for over ten years. The taller he grows, the more antennas he has. At first, he had only one, and now he has several. Ah—Federico has grown quite tall.'\n'Over ten years? Did the Law choose him to be a Saint that long ago?!'\n'Saint? Of course not. Back then, Federico was just Federico.'",
