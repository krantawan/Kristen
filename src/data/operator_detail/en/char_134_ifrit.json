Judging by Ifrit's current symptoms, we can at least tell that the treatment was unsuccessful.\nAs one of the Rhodes Island medical team's more demanding patients, Ifrit primarily receives care from Silence. This is consistent with information currently available from their time at Rhine Lab. Even after coming to Rhodes Island, the two have maintained the close relationship they built when they were both at the other company. \nIn terms of personality, Ifrit is a bit... immature. She acts like a 6-10 year old and is rebellious, impetuous, overconfident most of the time, even bordering on egotistical. She is extremely impulsive, ready to act the second an idea pops into her mind, no matter how dangerous it might be.\nOn the other hand, the outstanding form her Originium Arts take must be supported. Rhine Lab even created a flame-casting wand device to complement her talent. This gift pushed Ifrit to show off her abilities with even more bombast. \nIn short, after daily observation, we can say that Ifrit is someone who easily gets caught up in her emotions. For now, she doesn't have the ability to distinguish between right and wrong, and she's quite immature. In an extreme environment such as a battlefield, her instincts push her to fight against and even annihilate all those who get in her way. As a result, even if she never intended to do so, she has saved many lives.",

            "storyText": "According to the information we have available, Ifrit is a member of the Sarkaz race. However, the structure of her horns and her tail are quite different from typical Sarkaz. Even though current research on the Sarkaz and their traits is incomplete, at least compared to the other Sarkaz present at Rhodes Island, Ifrit's characteristics are quite unique. \nThe Sarkaz race maintains particular talent for Originium Arts, and Ifrit's talent far exceeds that of most Sarkaz. \nAccording to these observations, it is probable that Ifrit's racial characteristics have undergone some superficial changes triggered by her Oripathy. It's also possible that the Originium presence in her circulatory system is interfering with test results. These changes are irreversible and have proven an unexpected obstacle to the medical team's investigation: they are unable to determine which type of Sarkaz Ifrit is. \nIn addition, Ifrit's medical records show that she suffers from chronic nerve pain and even occasional hallucinations. Records describe these hallucinations as enormous apparitions that are tremendously painful for her, or depictions of charred corpses and immolated animals, or close personal relations consumed by a sea of agonizing fire. The causes of these apparitions have proven elusive to all medical and mechanical analyses. It is possible that this ongoing torment is the source of her irascible character. \nIn summary, Ifrit is an Operator that needs close monitoring, even by Rhodes Island standards. Anyone who comes into contact with Ifrit should have a full understanding of all this Operator's basic information before their exchange takes place.\n[Classified Log]\nThis record exists because Ifrit's physiological structure has already become quite peculiar. \nShe was a Sarkaz, but whether she is still indeed Sarkaz, I am unsure... This sudden feeling I have is difficult to describe...",

Pain mixed with anger, an anger that took her to fantasyland, a friendly-looking old Caprinae putting her on a sickbed, her hand trying to reach out and hold something, searching through a ruin and a blaze-scorched black, and something that feels like feathers, but in an instant it's gone, and nobody ever pulls her out.\n'Little friend, you've caught fire again.\n'You know, raging and screaming won't lessen your pain, nor will it ever solve anything.'\nCan it. All you do is talk in my brain and make my head hurt. You don't know anything!\n'But I can feel those pinpricks in your arms.\n'I've been able to feel them treat you as a monster since long ago. Even you yourself believed it, once.'\nThat was all that stupid goat's fault! He turned me into this, he...!\n'You resent Silence. You know she knows your past, yet she won't let you flame-roast that 'stupid goat' yourself.'\nShe... Silence isn't wrong for that! What do you know? I'd never blame her—\n'But your emotions still boil with wrath.\n'Didn't you decide? That you could sneak away, now that no one here binds you to a table anymore? And once you find the old goat, you'll beat his face to a pulp, burn his whole laboratory down, and then—'\n...I'm not gonna do that. I don't need Silence to tell me not to, 'cause I know that would be wrong. It's not that I wanna... kill him.\n...I <i>don't</i> know! Still, he...! Why can't I?! I've got fire, I'll burn it all—\n'You're shaking. You're recalling the days that inflicted so much pain upon you...\n'So stop.'\nNo... once I can control this fatso for real, I'll get to protect everyone, and Silence won't be like this anymore, and she won't fight with Saria either!\nAnd Darya can...\n'...You're crying.'\n...Shut up!\n'It's not your fault, little friend.'\n...Then whose fault is it?\nWho am I supposed to blame? I'm not supposed to burn that stupid goat up, so who do I blame...?\nThe voice dies down. No one responds anymore, and even the headache flags somewhat.\n'I still don't know.\n'Maybe, someday, you'll be able to separate the rights from the wrongs. Your experiences will tell you how to decide your own standards. You'll want to abide by them. And then, you'll do the right thing.'\n...Urk—my head hurts, my...\n'Shaw hid your charcoal grill in a corner of the depot under the stairs. Mint has some books she'd like to share with you. Beeswax has a bottle of fragrant perfume, and if you visit her, she'll be all too willing to coat your horns.\n'You know how mighty they all are. You want to protect them. So too do they want to protect you.\n'So what about that big fat talking balloon? It still worries you.'\n...I'm scared.\n'Fear can't limit you, Ifrit.'\nThe pain brought about by that voice is fading far away. She looks across an expanse of white. Who is responding to her?\n......\n'Sleep, Ifrit. No longer can those flames burn in our dreamlands, you and I. We will find peace.'\nAnd slowly, slowly, the flames go out.\nThe gargantuan being that occupied her dreamscape begins to wane, its fires fading crystal clear. Atop sleeps the unconscious Ifrit, who feels pain no longer. The fire blends into her. The fire, she has accepted.",

She remembers arguing with it, a long time ago. It said that fire was a force of destruction, that it was born to consume all things. Ifrit seems to hear its voice again.\n'Shut up,' Ifrit says, but swallows the words that should have followed—\nI'm doing something else with the fire. You just do your job.\nIfrit can feel the heat, but it is no longer oppressive, no longer urging her to burn everything around her. It has been a long time since Ifrit last had a fight with the fire. Flames no longer spout from her fingertips and horns out of the blue. She still has those burning dreams, where flames devour charred buildings, but she knows it is just a dream. The flames in the dream cannot hurt her or others any more.\nIfrit would not allow it.\nThe nightmares do not come from within herself.\nIfrit watches as the flames embrace the glass, slowly turning it orange-red. They expand with the air, and the glass gradually forms the shape of body and limb. The fatso has some skills, Ifrit thinks, as a tiny Feline begins to take shape in the flames.\nRosmontis often told Ifrit about her own dreams, a lab in her ice-cold nightmares, filled with strange instruments, with a long corridor outside. She has dreamt of walls being cut open like potatoes, the ceiling and the floor torn to pieces, iron pipes crushed into a ball... She said she was not alone in the dream. The Doctor was there, Muelsyse was there, and Ifrit was there, too. She said that her friends were in danger, and she wanted to destroy the danger. She said those nightmares had no ending; perhaps she was meant to see someone or do something, but she always wakes up before she could do so.\nIfrit has heard Rhodes Island and Rhine Lab staff say that Rosmontis' cognition is being rebuilt. She is working hard to rebuild her memories, like how she worked hard to build a castle with sand that day on the beach. Those painful memories would become part of the castle, too.\nBut memory should not be cold. At least, when we touch our memories, we should feel the hand of our friend, and we should feel that it is warm. The warmth of memory should be the warmth of fire.\n'Just know this: Your friends are waiting for you at the end of the dream,' says Ifrit to Rosmontis.\nSince that day, a tiny glass Feline has sat by Rosmontis' bedside, and a warm flame has burned within her heart.",
