In the end, Rhodes Island issued for Robin a fairly particular contract—much longer work hours than other Operators, with a further predetermined cut of all of Robin's mission earnings paid automatically to Rhodes Island, directly furnishing her father's medical fees.\nIn return, Rhodes Island would immediately provide her father treatment.",

Yet, people continually lapped by the fire of conflict find it no easy thing to return to everyday life. Their greatest joys will often be confined to liquor, music, reading, and sleep.\nPeople like the ever-freewheeling Chief Engineer Closure are few and far between across Rhodes Island, and on more than one occasion she's been frustrated at not finding someone of like mind to have fun watching movies and soaps together.\nRobin's arrival alleviated one of her problems; after all, just as the first record states, Robin is by no means naturally gloomy—she was undeniably an open, cheerful city girl in the past, and her greatest hobby happens to be watching movies.",

So she opted to bear her father's hysteria, all the while heading out alone, earning money by herself to keep the house going.\nIn spite of her relatively light build, she looked up to the robust, talented protagonists she'd seen since childhood in movies, and so when times at home were good, she took martial arts classes, and by her own efforts built up a good physique, as well as impressive combat skill for any ordinary person. Though adulthood came and she was nothing close to a hero who could plumb Paradise and Inferno alike, it did streamline finding herself a job.\nShe first tried to pursue mental labor, but she quickly realized such work couldn't support her father's spendthrift habits. Afterwards, she began seeking all sorts of physical work, and ultimately found a decent job as a bodyguard.\nThe job, however, was barely enough to maintain their livelihood, and she still sought better-paying work all throughout. Moreover, Robin has made it clear that during that period, how dangerous the work was no longer mattered much to her, as long as it could make any money.\nIndeed, she never imagined it'd be a turning point from where she'd meet Mountain and Silence, and eventually come to Rhodes Island.\nIn the end, even if her father can recover with Rhodes Island's aid, even greater problems will sooner or later arise should he fall back on his older self-abandoning ways, and it's clear that Robin would be powerless against them.\nThough it often doesn't end well when outsiders interfere in these types of domestic affairs, Robin herself has turned to the Doctor and asked for help, so it should be feasible at the least for the Doctor to offer her some suggestion of direction.\nWe hope for a day when things can improve for her.",
