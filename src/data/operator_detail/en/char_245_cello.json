Is the Notarial Hall in such in a rush?'\n'Does Leithanien require that report to understand the subject?'\n'[COUGHING]'\n'We have three hours reserved for our initial conference. Abide by the agreement, Federico—the Empresses' Voice has the right to read through the report first.'\n'Three hours. I will begin timing.'\n'This conference is being held by the Rhodes Island Human Resources Department. Additionally, Amiya will be present to assist us in our understanding of the subject's Originium Arts.'\n'How soon we meet, Miss Amiya. With her present, maybe you'll all rest a little easier around me.\n'But of course, I know you won't.'\n[07:38/05:35:36]\n[Pause Transmission]\n\n[Conference Log: attachment #2: Opinion from the Institute of Telepathy]\n......\nIf we adopt the theory put forward by several interviewees in the early-stage investigation reports concerning Virtuosa, then the Arts she grasps could be said, in essence, to 'magnify' others' emotions to the point of 'urging' them to take impulsive action, which leads to our falling into the easy trap of lumping it in with other mental Arts—or as we would categorize them in Leithanien, 'telepathic-perceptual'—thus considering it either a simple illusion-/mirage-based construct, or a form of so-called 'mind control.'\nHowever, the fact of the matter is that Virtuosa's Arts are exceedingly rare. Given our as-yet-insufficient study of her type of Originium Arts, it's no wonder we might have misjudged its effective mechanisms, and hence arrived at an erroneous conclusion.\n......\nOf all the investigation reports, a 1092 Lateran Notarial Hall case file logs the greatest detail, and serves as our most useful reference. Within, the author Federico generalizes Virtuosa's Arts as an 'empathetic expansion,' presumably owing to his Lateran familiarities. From there, we conjecture something most interesting: that Virtuosa's unique Arts may well be the result of Sankta empathic abilities acting in concert with telepathic-perceptual Arts. Based on this hypothesis, we launched further research into her Arts with the assent of multiple conference parties, herself, and the test subjects.\n......\nIn the course of our research, we carried out both individual and multi-person tests. We have only made a brief summary in this report; detailed test logs and participant feedback will be recorded elsewhere.\nIn individual tests, when Virtuosa performed music using her Originium Arts, we picked up both the music and the subject's emotional impulse in a coinciding frequency range on three separate detectors. She was seemingly able to 'perceive' this coinciding range, and use Arts to bring about some sort of 'resonance' effect—this resonance was not limited to the subject and the music, but affected the caster as well, i.e. Virtuosa's own emotional impulses (see attachment #3).\nIn multi-person tests, Virtuosa demonstrated to us another mode of her Originium Arts—the effect she displayed during Das Kaiserinnensfest, and one of pertinent interest to all parties at the conference. She had three subjects experience simultaneous emotional resonance (see attachment #6); the concrete manner in which she achieved this is something we still haven't ascertained.\n......\n\n[Conference Log: attachment #4: Subject #1: Mrs. ■■■■■]\nWithout personally undergoing it, I fear one could hardly know how Virtuosa's Arts acts upon her 'subjects,' much like how the Sankta have a limited ability to explain to others just how their empathy works.\nAs a researcher of consciousness and cognition, I've always been fond of likening the human consciousness to a lake. Our typical actions and motivations are merely the scenery mirrored in its surface; the thing we call the subconscious, no more than the fins and pebbles some meters under. We often take the existence of the lake for granted, forgetting that we have each drop of water to thank for begetting it—each moment of sadness and triumph, each moment of thought and feeling—as they pour into this grand lake and become one with it. Thus we observe and see only a great body of water, not the minute, endless trickles.\nVirtuosa's Arts are able to separate and distinguish the water back into those constituent trickles. Under the effect of her Arts, every depth of our consciousnesses, including those we've long forgotten—our buried or deliberately hidden memories—are given an emphasis they've never known. Such memories are usually associated with the strongest emotions stirred by the melody itself. They float to the surface on their own, and cause us to reconsider the manner in which the lake of our consciousness <i>is.</i> We sometimes underestimate on how real a level such reconsideration changes our behavior, and influences our judgment.\nThat said, after undergoing today's experiments, Virtuosa's Arts have had me find that merely analogizing to 'a lake' is altogether insufficient to describe the breadth of human consciousness, or to account for the grand billows that her music can stir within it. As such, 'the sea of consciousness' may be a more apt metaphor.\n\n[Outcome of Meeting]\nJoint deliberation by all convened parties concludes that the functional mechanisms by which Operator 'Virtuosa's' Arts can work are as yet unclear, and still of inestimable risk. Therefore, per agreement she is to be transferred to Rhodes Island to await further observation and study. Virtuosa will continue to require supervision while at Rhodes Island: all conduct will be subject to consistent scrutiny, anything spoken must be logged, and she is forbidden from performing anything without authorization.\n\n[Classified Log]\nTheir hypothesis at the conference was correct. Virtuosa's Arts can stir people's innermost and most significant memories, which then arouse some given state of mind, thus forming emotions. However, she cannot, by her own will, alter the memories reawakened in people when they hear her music. Nor can she show them, or put them through, emotions or experiences that have never existed. She cannot make the sad laugh heartily, nor turn despots merciful. The great power exhibited by her Arts is a resonance between music and a person's awakened ego. Virtuosa herself has long been aware of this: she has not once attempted to invert another's nature through her music. Not for helplessness, but for wisdom.",

            "storyText": "After highly protracted discussion, Rhodes Island has ultimately made the decision to admit Virtuosa in operator capacity. Though her movements are not to be strictly circumscribed, we have been pressured to request that the associated operator—i.e. Executor—follow her during her time aboard, 'so as to keep her safe.' In any case, no matter how you slice it, Virtuosa now has some amount of freedom.\nIt is unavoidable, however, that her arrival has perturbed Rhodes Island's collective nerves. Rumors have circulated of her exploits prior to boarding, and on the same token, various departments have separately hammered home what to watch for when interacting with her. From the perspective of our operators, this only further proves the magnitude of her power. If her cello could incite such disturbances in Sargon, Columbia, and even the heart of Leithanien, it is difficult to imagine the effect it could have on Rhodes Island.\nEven so, not once has a performance of it been indulged aboard the landship. This restriction comes not just from Rhodes Island, or even the ever-present, ever-close, gun-toting Executor; the will of the cellist herself is the greatest hindrance. The fastener binding the cello's strings has not been loosened here in a very long time. She has, on record, invited other operators to pluck its strings, but never do they vibrate, instead remaining steadfastly silent.\n'It doesn't matter if a piece is a masterpiece or not, and while the respect a performer has for it does, it's the piece itself that has the final say. Rhodes Island's movement is enough of a masterpiece already, and it'd be far too discourteous of me to keep ruining it with a tuneless din.'\n\n[Classified Log]\nIllusions can often arouse complex moods in people, but one aspect is consistent—loneliness. Virtuosa's, however, differs. I can sense how she, hand in hand with her audience, faithfully walks each brief journey of the heartstrings to its end. She avails of the listener's ear so as to listen together, and so too of the listener's eye, so as to weep together. Her listeners are never alone. Virtuosa is, in a sense, undeniably sincere.",

Certainly, Arturia has ignited our interest in cases—though I personally despise any terminology that suggests the phenomenon is an illness—of errari, or in your vernacular, the 'astray.' We owe this secondarily to her nomadic lifestyle and primarily to her being, to a degree, 'banished' in the eyes of the Holy City. Rationally speaking, per our prior understanding of the astray, we would expect Arturia's empathic ability at this point to be quite diminished since her time in the Holy City. However, we made a quantitative comparison of her empathic ability between the two periods and found that it had not only refused to weaken, but had reached an all-new state through her Arts—needless to say, you may trust that we've experienced firsthand the might of her one-of-a-kind 'empathy.' Yet just how did her empathy become so developed amidst such a long-term errari lifestyle? I believe we can find our answer in her prolonged experience roaming across Terra.\nOf course, calling it 'empathy' is a matter of my own personal taste, a concept I can trust my fellow Laterans to comprehend, but whether through the lens of mode of operation, principle of action, or resultant effect, Arturia's Arts are absolutely and thoroughly distinct from true empathy. We are currently held back by issues of facilities and permissions; come the time for her to properly return to the Holy City, we under the auspices of the Sixth Tribunal will invite even more doctors of psychiatry—even the idiots from the Seventh Tribunal's 66th—to administer an even more comprehensive exam.\nI have the faint feeling that Arturia is capable of doing more for our law and order than simply damaging it. Likewise, the sin she committed and the reproach she receives may not be bearable by her alone. When the time comes, I bid the law determine.",

      "desc": "Her tutor seems very late to today's lesson, but the student hardly cares. She's always hated this tutor anyway. Clearly she's good enough to finish this whole cello solo unguided! But somehow, her tutor's just never satisfied.\nCertainly, she can't play as well as her tutor. Oh, she's <i>tried</i> to submerge herself in the score, to converse without care with the composer she never got to know. But those ebon-black markings have stayed silent on their chalk-white scores. Their mysterious composer passed away almost a century ago; they say she died all alone, and practically left no trace she ever lived save for a few of her scores. It's not in her grasp to comprehend the passion and sorrow that lie within each movement, nor does she have a clue who that 'ever-lost lover' hiding with the score really was, or why they were struck by such fits of madness.\nAnd so she can only but play as the score instructs, emotionlessly. At first, it goes well enough. She can still feel the brush of each note, feel them settle in her heart. But as the movements progress, and the music enters its passages of true frothing turbulence, the leaps, the repeats, those elegant trills and appoggiaturas, it all embraces her with fervor. They invite her to a mad dance, but step by step, her gait follows less and less. Tempestuous crescendos and diminuendos barrel violently through her vision, only to slip away next instant to the score's furthest reaches. She tries to catch them, grab hold of each glittering moment that accompanies them, struggling in the midst of the endlessly long staff to the point her strings' tremors can no longer rouse those worked-up emotions, and their place is taken by the repetitious back-and-forth of the metronome, clack, clack, clack, clack... echoing lonely in her ears, until the impassioned music agonizingly lingers no longer, as if this betrayal was preordained.\nAnd thus, the energy fades from her fingertips as does that beautiful passage, leaving only the metronome still chiming away. Clack, clack, clack, clack... This imperfect silence becomes a parting declaration. At this, the fury and despair that lurk in her heart burst forth, becoming the heat in the tears her eyes brim with. Her vision blurs—the plain white score before her bids her final throes of resistance. She snatches the quill, and upon the score engraves each and every leap, every repeat, every elegant trill and appoggiatura, every tempestuous crescendo and diminuendo. Jet-black like cast iron shackles, she knows she's gone mad, but this is the only way she has to bind her ever-lost lover to her side. Before the final barline ends it all, her life will flow with the music.\nAnd this is when the cello grinds to a halt. She finds herself holding the bow, the cello silently resting upon her bosom, and the strings are not quivering, and the metronome is not rocking, and all that fills the chamber is her heavy breathing. And her Sankta tutor, with her black gloves, gently brushes a hand over hers, and speaks in the same soft and gentle tone as ever.\n'Your playing today was perfect,' she congratulates her, content. 'The composer's life, and her love, flowed within your performance.'",
