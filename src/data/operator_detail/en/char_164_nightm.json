However, her infection disrupted her future plans. Today, Gloria is still unable to recall how she got infected (it is worth noting her sessions all alluded to an alternate personality, 'Nightmare,' and it seemed only 'Nightmare' could recall how it happened). Temporary memory loss is a common symptom of Oripathy, so all investigations should take that into account.\nAccording to our intel, Gloria had at least six months of combat experience before joining Rhodes Island. Her militant 'Nightmare' personality seems to be the one behind the stint.",

A number of tests done by warlock Operators has found the staff can increase the effectiveness of healing arts, but they must be performed in a manner similar to hypnosis. Feedback from test subjects also indicated they almost always dreamed in this hypnotized state.

Are the flowers and fragrances here able to calm you down?\nYes...\nIs 'Nightmare' causing your panic?\nI don't know.\nGloria, for this consultation, I'd like to chat with you. I'll need you to try not to let 'Nightmare' come out. Can you do that?\nI... I can try.\nGood, I trust in you. If she's about to come out, you warn me as loudly as you can, okay?\nMm. Let's begin. Last consultation, you said you were awake while 'Nightmare' came out. What did it feel like, during that time?\nIt felt like... like I was sitting in front of a big screen. The sounds, and pictures... were all really clear, but I wasn't able to do anything.\nYou did something to take back control of your body. Can you describe that?\nI ran and ran, and there were all these threads pulling at me, sticky, and dark, and I was pulling those threads... [COUGH], [COUGH]!\nGloria, are you alright? You have a very bad cough there.\nCould I have a cup of water, doctor?\nHere.\nThank you.\nLet's continue. Were you doing that because you don't like 'Nightmare' occupying your body? So you'd like to get rid of her?\nNo, I just feel... helpless. Like if I don't do this, I'll lose something.\nWhat do you think of 'Nightmare'?\nShe's different from me. She does things I can't do. It scares me a little.\nDo you consider the two of you independent from each other?\nProbably.\nSuppose, and this is only me supposing, that one day, out of the two of you, only you were left. How would you feel?\nI don't know... [COUGH] Sorry, I need more water.\nRelax, it's okay. Now, we're going to try a slightly different method for our chat.\nI'm going to have you recall some quite deep memories. Don't worry, I promise it can't hurt you in any way.\nMm. Watch my three fingers carefully. One by one, I'll bend them down, and they'll sink slowly into the deepest parts of your mind.\nThree.\nTwo.\nOne.\nAre you Gloria?\nYes.\nGloria, can you recall when 'Nightmare' first emerged?\nI don't remember exactly when, just... that night, I had a bad dream.\nA bad dream?\nMm, I dreamed there was a white wall, with very bright corridor lights, and lots of people, and a lot of blood... and then, she appeared.\nSo she first appeared in your dream?\nYes.\nWas she doing anything?\nI remember, I dreamed she... saved me.\nShe saved you? And did she do anything else?\nAh... [COUGH]! Water, I need...\nCalm down, take me through slowly.\nHere—agh! That's my hand!\nHeh. Heheh.\n'Nightmare'! But why wasn't there any sign?\nOh, Gloria clearly warned you, you just didn't notice. What did you think? My imitation of her's quite a good one, isn't it?\nRequesting backup! 'Nightmare'—\nHush, not loud. Now, do you think that really was a bad dream? And just which of us could be after the Originium?\nThe twinflower, the doublet... truth and lie. How are you supposed to tell them apart?\nAlright, now listen to me. Hand over the Originium...\n—RECORDING ENDS HERE.",
