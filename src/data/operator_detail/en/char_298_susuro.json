Sometimes this was to help her younger sister get back snacks her brothers had stolen, and sometimes this was to help her sister get a hold of a toy she couldn't have. Since her childhood, Sussurro has developed a personality that takes initiative.\nSussurro's two older brothers have already grown up and have gone into business. Her younger sister is studying in kindergarten. Sussurro herself chose to study medicine. She did not do so out of any grand ambition or dream, but because the medical industry in Siracusa holds promise and is a good field to work in.",

Her small figure was often bouncing between the different buildings on campus, and her short stature notwithstanding, all of her abilities steadily progressed.\nLuckily for Sussurro, she got to make a solid group of friends between classes and maintained good relationships with some older students. These medical students all embraced the same dreams, confronted the same challenges, and worked towards the future together. With everyone's help and encouragement, Sussurro managed to press on through the long, dull days in her time as a medical student.\nThough Sussurro originally had no aspirations of her own, through making friends with all kinds of people, she gradually came to understand the reasoning behind their choices. Whether it was to secure a job with a stable salary and life environment, out of a genuine desire to help others, or just out of pure interest in biology, Sussurro found their aspirations infectious. She liked everyone who had a dream and worked hard to fulfill it, and at the same time, her own thinking became clear:\nDoes becoming a doctor hold any special meaning for me?",

The professor and student mentors haven't shown any symptoms—which is to say, ordinary contact with an Infected, and even treatment of them, likely doesn't lead to infection at all.\nWhich lets me confirm that I was only infected because I made contact with Originium while it was in an active state.\nAs for the active Originium's origins: Was this region already polluted by Originium?—Unlikely, because the professor and student mentors weren't infected. Was it my contact with Infected blood?—Not impossible.\nI can be sure that Infected blood carries traces of active Originium. If so, I need to distinguish whether the areas I contacted at the time were open wounds, how long the contact lasted, the freshness of contacted blood, etc. For all factors.\nIf there was a wound, fresh blood was contacted, and contact was prolonged, I can hypothesize resultant infection was inevitable; if there was a wound, stale blood was contacted, and contact was brief, would infection occur? This can determine whether or not Originium activity in the blood of Infected wanes as time passes. Also, if there was no wound and fresh blood was contacted; if there was no wound, stale blood was contacted...\nUnfortunately, I don't remember the exact circumstances. Actually, I don't even know how I was infected. I was too busy...\nBut I do remember that before I discovered Originium crystals on my body, I had a fever, headaches, and other symptoms. Right, I was under the impression for a few days that I'd fallen ill from overwork. Now I see it must have been a sort of initial onset of the Oripathy infection. I often hear patients give similar accounts of their own circumstances during diagnosis.\nPlus, given a view informed by the critical care of Infected over the past days, my own condition is relatively mild, but I can't be sure of anything without further tests.\nThat's the best summary I can give for now. If I think of anything else later, I'll add it here.\nThe professor and mentors are staying here to continue their assignments. Aside from providing some practical accounts of Infected life from the perspective of a doctor, I'm not much help anymore. I'm currently searching for a medical organization that specializes in researching and treating Oripathy. As volunteers in the face of this still-unknown disease, we can't provide very effective care to those who need it most, and there may even be further infections down the line. We need more specialized, in-depth research before we can confront this sickness.\nWould such an organization exist?\n—Sussurro's diary entry following Oripathy diagnosis"
