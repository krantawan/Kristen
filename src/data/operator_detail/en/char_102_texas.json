I've never heard it. I keep to myself, you know.'\n'What happened? Everything was normal, I was there at the counter spacing out. A little shop like ours doesn't do much business at three in the afternoon. Students are still in school, and the office types come by at noon to stretch their limbs for a bit before their bosses pull them back to work. I suppose officers like you on patrol mind our business now and again. Do you know Madame Oni? The tall, tall Inspector with a horn on her head? She and I—'\n'Black suits! Er, I was a little nervous, there must've been twenty in all. Us ordinary folks never see things like that. They were all rushing Miss Texas and that briefcase, and whatever they had in their hands, they were shiny and glinting! You see something like that for real, I dare say, and it makes those movies look like child's play! You know, Ah Sir, I'm a professional, I've seen every kung fu movie to ever come out in Lungmen, but the way Miss Texas squared up was completely different. She doesn't even seem that old. I don't dare imagine where she learned those insane moves, or how she got so trained.'\n'Right, the camera has me hiding under the counter, but I heard it all crystal clear! A dagger got sent flying and landed right next to me! Then a red-haired Sankta came in, I think probably to help Miss Texas, because I heard them say hi. She was called Exusiai? And then there was this whole massive rumble, that was something wild! I could feel my own liver shaking!'\n'Then it all died down, and I found the guts to come out from under the counter, and the black suits were all on the ground, and my shop was—ah, you don't have to worry about that, there were two big stars who came by later on. Miss Sora was one, and then the other was that rapping Liberi. They compensated me wonderfully, enough I could fix up my shop and open a cystybeast meatball stall.'\n'What about Texas? Er, she... she picked out some snacks after it went down and went to me to pay. It was the kind that's really popular with schoolkids, the biscuit sticks with the coating. She bought a whole handful of boxes. Chocolate, vanilla and the new salted one, and she bought a woven bag for a dollar too.'\n'What do you mean, I'm not telling you anything useful? You listen to me, that bag is designed by our shop! It's got cartoons on it!'\n'Alright, enough from me. Still, Ah Sir, there's one more thing—do you L.G.D. people know this Miss Texas? Tell her for me: the reward from her stamp card came in, a limited edition baseball cap, so if she can drop in when she's got the time...'\nNote by personnel on shift: Filed under Folder-Penguin Logistics 1097 (102), all charges on incident provisionally dropped.",
