After waking up on the second day, while passing from the dormitory to the cafeteria, and then through three floors on the way to the workshop, he greeted no less than 15 operators hailing from all over Terra. Not only did he remember everyone's names correctly, he even used the little-known real names of a few of them.\nThe combat records show that during the special operation in Londinium, he was the first Self-Salvation Corps member to extend a hand of friendship to Rhodes Island. This was obviously due to his personality. An Engineering operator who quickly befriended him revealed that Stainless does not employ any particular social technique. 'Well, it's just that when someone looks at you so sincerely and enthusiastically, and takes the initiative to talk to you, you can't help but go along with it and treat him as an old friend.' So says the relatively introverted operator.\nThough lively and cheerful, Stainless does not carelessly ignore other people's feelings and try to force his friendship on them. On the contrary, he is always sensitive towards his friends' emotional states. Many operators often receive little handmade gifts from him when feeling down, and these intricate trinkets inevitably bring a smile to their face.\n'My popularity within the department has been in a freefall ever since Feist arrived!' Closure complained aloud. 'I always suspected him of trying to poach my subordinates, but luckily we managed to get him on our side first... Wait a minute, don't tell me he's plotting to depose me as Chief Engineer?!'",

            "storyText": "When working, Stainless's hands are very steady, far moreso than you'd expect from someone in their early twenties.\nBefore joining the Londinium Citizens' Self-Salvation Corps, he worked for nearly a decade in the Londinium military factories. Moreover, before he officially became a worker, he was an apprentice for seven or eight years.\nIt can be said that he was an artificer from the moment he could pick up a drill and a spanner.\nVictoria's machinery industry is extremely advanced, and Londinium's military factories are at the cutting edge of its technological prowess. Each of these factories is close to the size of a small neighborhood, with neatly segregated zones and criss-crossed with automated assembly lines and piping that form a self-contained transportation network. Conveyer belts connect these factories both internally and externally, ensuring a highly efficient flow of raw materials and intermediate products, while mechanical arms large and small handle the majority of the streamlined grunt work. As for the workers who move about these large machines, their role is to maintain this mechanized assembly system, performing repairs and system updates as needed. Despite being just an ordinary worker, Stainless's knowledge of engineering theory is on par with a Columbian graduate in mechanical engineering. Moreover, he also has strong practical skills. No matter how precise a machine is, there are always some manufacturing processes that require fine observation and adaptability, thus requiring the hands and attention of a skilled craftsman.\nThis style of work is quite different from what the engineering operators of Rhodes Island are accustomed to. Including Closure, our engineers rely much more on individual creativity to complete their work. Based on the work habits of each team, the workshop is also divided into multiple smaller areas. This means that Rhodes Island rarely produces standardized 'official' equipment. Even a weapon specially created for the same operator may change drastically between each maintenance.\nRegardless, Stainless was able to quickly settle into his role as a Rhodes Island engineer. On one hand, he used his knowledge of automation to make Closure a series of proposals that greatly enhanced the efficiency of Rhodes Island's landship maintenance protocols. On the other hand, he has excitedly exchanged ideas with every engineer in Rhodes Island, coming up with all kinds of new ideas and rapidly implementing them. The operation platform he designed and manufactured has already reached its 13th iteration, while Rockrock's drones are also being quickly upgraded. He even borrowed the technology Closure uses to modify Lancet-2 and other operation platforms to enhance his own platform, installing a screen on it to express emotions and improve its developing smart dialogue capabilities.\n'Those overly advanced automation technologies in Londinium ended up holding back his potential.' Mechanist notes. 'But the solid training he's received will become a strong foundation for his overly active imagination.'",

            "storyText": "Stainless was born and raised in Londinium's Highbury Borough.\nThe first thing that comes to mind about Highbury is always its grand expanse of factory buildings and dense worker dormitories. Due to the factories that never rest, the air is always hot and humid, and carries about it the smell of machine oil and iron rust. Unlike the spacious factory interiors, everything outside is tightly packed. The overground rail stations pass right through buildings, while the fruit stalls are right next to the garbage disposal. A layer of black grime covers the walls and streets, which not even the heavy rains of Londinium can wash away.\nThe residents of Highbury are primarily local workers. They spend most of their time in the factories every day, and take the railway back to their dormitories after work. They repeat this busy schedule daily, working to hold up the city famous for its industry, yet most of them have never even seen what the other boroughs of Londinium look like. Due to the city council's planning, the tall dormitories around the outer edge form a singular wall, preventing the rust-laden air from wafting towards other boroughs, while also preventing the workers from seeing past it. They know nothing of the museums and opera houses of the Auchterigg Borough, nor the villas and gardens of the Magna Borough.\nStainless's descriptions of Highbury also reveal another aspect to it.\n'You must have eaten fried fin and potato pies in Victoria, right? Highbury has the best fried fin and potato pie stalls in the whole of Londinium. The stall owners I know all work fast and don't skimp on ingredients. It's what you have to do to survive running a food stall in Highbury. \n'There's also the taverns. We always head to the taverns after work every Friday. You never need to worry about getting home after drinking too much, since everyone around you is a friend.'\n'I also like the lifts in the dormitories! Haha, they were built from scrap materials by the workers living there, and can get you from the top floors to the underground transportation pipelines in no time at all. I used to climb up and down them when I was a kid, and it always ended with me getting spanked by my granny...'\nWhen the Sarkaz entered Highbury, they did almost no damage to the factories. To an outsider, the busy and crowded Highbury may have looked no different from how it always had. However, Stainless knew well that his cherished life had already disappeared. Many food stalls had shuttered, Sarkaz mercenaries patrolled the roads from the factories to the taverns, and even his beloved lifts had been destroyed by the Defense Forces for being a security risk.\nAs Stainless put it, the reason he left Highbury to join the Londinium Citizens' Self-Salvation Corps was for 'Home and Liberty.' That simple joy in his memories is what kept him going through battle after battle.",

What will their next step be? Would they find out that the Sarkaz are not the sole source of suffering for the Londiniers?\nThat group of youngsters may call themselves warriors, but they have never experienced war.\nI've seen many wars like this.\nWar brings pain. Weapons and shells, they're nothing but flesh wounds. The self-doubt and remorse of watching your friends and family sacrifice themselves while you remain helpless is far worse. And well, the worst pains don't even come from your enemies.\nFeist trusts others easily, especially those he calls friends. He believes that everyone is just like him, willing to stand up and resist a common foe, all for the sake of protecting each other and pursuing a better future.\nHe does not understand... It's instinctual to wish for a better life, but that's not the same as being willing to fight for one.\nHe will surely experience betrayal in the future. It will leave an indelible scar upon his heart.\nAt the end of this war, will youngsters like him still be able to trust others so easily, and carry such a pure hope towards life?\nBefore, I didn't think so.\nNow... Heh, I must admit, that young'un is stronger than I gave him credit for.

There were no Sarkaz around, and no armies or anything either. I didn't want to stop, so our factory just kept flying on. There was obviously nothing in front of us, but it still felt so vast to me... Ugh, isn't that such a silly dream? It's not?

No wonder he'd dubbed the plans 'Dreams' and stuck them in the most eye-catching spot of his workbench.\nThe creativity on show in the blueprints was succinct: Preserve the motor core of an FMC, then upgrade it with an all-terrain ambulatory mechanical installation.\n'How many neat automation ideas has this guy got hidden up in that head of his?' Closure was heard to say in appraisal, which served to stir up Engineering even more. Finally, one voice said what everyone was secretly thinking—\n'Let's get this thing made while he's out in the field!'\nPredictably they came to a resounding agreement. They'd all received Feist's help in ways both big and small, or been given one of his timely little presents. Moreover, not one operator there would ever refuse the chance to make someone's dream a reality.\nSeveral workshops joined hands and got down to work, all of Engineering bustling like nobody's business. Driven by wanting to finish it before Feist got back, sticking points were overcome one after another, and progress flew by far smoother than usual. Very soon, the main chassis was fully built, short of just one final step: merging it with a Feist Metal Crab motor system.\nOnce 'MERGE SUCCESSFUL' flashed up on their giant display, ardent applause filled all of Engineering. A brand spanking new automated transport vehicle could enter operation, and it couldn't have happened without the combined hard work of Feist and every single other engineer. Some operators had already begun to imagine how he would react to seeing it: would a lad who'd pulled himself out of the fires of war shed a tear or two? Or would he laugh like mad and give everyone a giant hug?\nThat was when a question came that threw everyone off, its asker stood over by the generator.\n'How does the FMC motor system... actually work?'\nClearly, nobody had given thought to this one little detail preserved from the design, and a moment of silence ensued that felt like forever.\n'Hey, what're you lot all gathered in here for?'\nFeist, who'd come back aboard earlier, gave the crowd a puzzled stare before his eyes fell on the little sheetmetal fellow they surrounded. He blinked, then blinked again, making sure he wasn't just hallucinating.\n'Hold on, you got the Crawler all built? I don't know what to say!'\nAll of Engineering's eyes were on him as he picked up a steel pipe and gave the 'Crawler' a hefty tap on the back. With a loud rumble, the 'Crawler' slowly whirred into motion. That was the instant that reminded everyone just how the FMC operated.\nA few days later, the children aboard Rhodes got the gift Stainless had promised them: a little people-carrying robot that moved when you struck it. There in the shade of a thicket of steel, both his and their dreams had come true at once.\nNow they just needed to find an open space, and everyone could experience the joy of riding a burdenbeast.",

      "desc": "Rhodes Island has been invited to tour Highbury, which in recent times is all but the beating heart of Victorian industry. So, you, together with a convoy of operators looking forward to some exchange study, step for the first time in a while onto its formerly war-blighted soil.\nAll is not as you left it. No longer is Highbury crossed with heat and the sweat of brows; now, it's a well-oiled machine, the picture of order. With a grin, Stainless tells you that you've the Londinium Industry Development Association to thank—they've brought together every factory, advanced every proposal, combined every assembly line they could to produce the Highbury of today.\nYou don't tell him you heard as much on the factory tour you just took (you've been at this since morning, and it was your hunger that had you leave the rest of the ops to their tour while you nipped out for a bite to eat); it's been a while since you've seen Stainless talk so glowingly, and you're not about to interrupt him. You just nod along while you scan about for that smashing fried fin place he told you of the last time you were in town.\nWhat greets you when you get there, though, is a random factory's side door. Only then in your hunger do Stainless's words register properly: the whole borough's layout got revised, which meant the fin place had to move premises. Your stomach chooses this moment to grumble loudly.\n'What's that, Doctor, getting peckish? I was just going to say, that best chippy in town I told you about a while back? It's right here!'\nYou nod, perplexed as to why Stainless is stopping here... and opening the door to beckon you in. Is he <i>trying</i> to starve you?\nA moment later, a giant stonking thing appears before your eyes with a thunderous boom. Stainless skips over and hops into the cockpit, and shakes you out of your stunned stupor with a yell. 'The Crawler! Doctor, I give you The Crawler!\nDidn't I mention we were revising the borough layout? Well, they wanted to optimize out the food stands, up the place's total usability—but I didn't think so! Factories might define Highbury, but so do our little eateries!'\n'So?' you shout back, swept along by his sudden fervor.\n'So—'\nWith Stainless at the helm, THWOOMP! The Crawler's shell unfolds in all directions to reveal its inner workings—and what should greet you but several stands. One stand's owner in particular is frying her fins with the half an arm the war left her, and she's deft as ever. She greets you all smiles.\n'How's that for a show? A decommissioned first-model Crawler! Couldn't leave it gathering dust on the factory floor, and I so happen to have a stand to run! Now it's the Nomadic Food Crawler! Look, got my hand-drawn sign up there and everything!'\nYou're dumbstruck, and in your dumbstruckedness climb up a Crawler leg and into the thing, and continue to be dumbstruck as Stainless guides you through ordering a whole table's worth of food. Finally, your mouth closes again around a bite of crisp golden battered fin, and you feel happiness permeate all throughout you. It's now that you see Stainless up in the Crawler's cockpit, the wind tousling his hair, and when he looks over his shoulder, your eyes meet.\n'Doctor! This is a lot like that dream I told you about, right? That stupid, barmy dream.'\nYou nod.\nHe throws his arms wide open as he welcomes the wind and sun that rush to greet him. 'Doctor, I think I've made it come true.'",
