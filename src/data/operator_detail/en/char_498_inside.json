Insider appears to have an affable personality—which at first made everyone glad he was the same kind of person as Enforcer—but after interacting with him for some time, we have gradually come to realize the huge difference between the two. \nWhile Enforcer is undeniably gentle and warm-hearted, Insider has a more seasoned and slick way of doing things. He routinely prioritizes keeping himself safe while on the job, and this has honed his standards to a level that we must admit is difficult to come by without ample years of experience. \nThe recurring topic of 'Between Executor and Enforcer, who's normal for the Notarial Hall, and who's the weirdo?' can be put to rest, at least for now. The more we come to understand our collaborating operators, the more we realize— \nEach Notarial Hall executor has their own distinctive personality, as well as a standard for combat prowess well beyond that of ordinary people, which needs no further emphasis.

So far, our Lateran operators have held no less than ten dessert competitions under a variety of names, with the latest one involving Insider's handmade frosted donuts. Their incredibly high sugar content stunned everyone present, and even the ultimate sugar-loving Laterans admitted the donuts were so sweet they could feel themselves getting fatter with every bite. Insider acknowledged that he modified the original recipe to use nearly quadruple the sugar, which to him was just the right amount. \nOur best guess is that his love for sugar stems from something he went through in childhood. According to the information we managed to find, it is extremely rare for Sankta children to live astray outside Laterano. While we have no idea what exactly caused Insider to lose his parents as a child and grow up in a Siracusan border town, the experience has undoubtedly left its mark on him. He spent his childhood materially and mentally destitute, and we have learned that in the neighborhood he grew up in, there sits a decaying and dilapidated church run by an old Sankta friar, a place left forgotten on weekdays. But it is precisely because of this safe haven that Insider and his fellow street urchins had the opportunity to grow up without running into trouble. \nOne can imagine that he might have grown up to join a small local Famiglia, had a certain incident not occurred which changed his life's trajectory: the appearance of a squad from Laterano passing by while on a mission. This group of Laterans found the shabbily dressed young man with a wary gaze out on the streets, and after hearing his story, decided to bring the boy back to Laterano, to let him live the happy life that a Sankta deserved. \nIt was on the way to Laterano that the young Sankta tasted a dessert for the first time. \nIt seems logical then, for him to have fallen in love with sweetness then and there.",

Like his colleague Executor, he will always find a way to complete the mission, no matter how thorny the task. Of course, there is a requirement to meet before that happens: one must successfully persuade him to accept that task in the first place. After all, he excels in avoiding troublesome jobs; one could even say he has perfected the art. \nIn most cases, he will be unwilling to accept any missions that appear too difficult, hard to deal with, or will saddle him with heavy responsibilities. He makes no secret of this attitude; rather than chasing down fugitives or infiltrating locations, he'd prefer to deal with the trivial problems of Laterano's citizens, along with some unexpected yet ridiculously embarrassing incidents. Only when there is no one else available will he sigh and take action to swiftly settle the incident (or the instigator), while in the same breath asking for a large amounts of overtime pay. \nBut precisely because of his habitual aversion to troublesome matters, everyone was shocked when he asked if Rhodes Island could accept some Sarkaz workers. \n\n[Voice Log]\n'I don't really like meddling in other people's affairs, and some situations are especially difficult to get myself out of once I get involved. But... *sigh* How do I put this? Even an ordinary guy like me, who just wants to live a peaceful life, can get a little emotional, a little touched, from seeing where someone trying their best to chase their ideals can end up. \n'It's not like I'm a cold-blooded person with a heart of stone, I'm happy to help out even if it's just a little. Within the limits of my abilities and while I'm just passing by, of course. There are just too many people out there living poor or unsustainable lives. Sanctilaminium Ambrosii is special, but not extraordinary. \n'There's not much I can do either. I can only make a few suggestions, but in the end, it's up to Rhodes Island... I mean, Serpilia and Federico are running around hard at work, so wouldn't I stand out if I wasn't doing anything? \n'My intentions back then? Why I jammed the doors? Uh, haha, who did you hear that from...? It was an urgent situation, and anyone at the scene would've felt like something seriously bad was about to happen, right? So of course I had to make some preparations in advance. Clean-up work isn't the most glamorous job around, but someone's gotta do it. I do agree with Oren that if things really went awry, it would've been extremely troublesome to deal with, so taking some precautionary measures would have saved us a lot of time...'",

Some say that Sanktas are optimists, and others say they're a merry lot, but Insider has given us another answer. \nHe believes that the typical Sankta is 'blind.' \nHe clarified that this is not an insult. He does not mean that the typical Sankta is ignorant or lacks purpose, but rather something more straightforward: most Sankta living in Laterano have never truly understood how people outside the city live. \nMost of them, born with wings of light and a halo atop their heads, are indeed carefree optimists. They may set off some small explosions on the streets, creating chaos everyday and sending the Pontifica Cohors and Notarial Hall staff running around, but the city of Laterano has always been one of order, and these lively events simply add a little luster to the city. There is an unshakeable order hidden beneath the Sankta's laid-back behavior. Most of them have never experienced material scarcity, injustice, or irrationality, such that these concepts mean little to them. They have never had to think about them, and thus will never worry about them. \n'You can't possibly ask someone who's never seen a circle to describe what a circle looks like, right?' This is what Operator Insider told us. 'But does it even matter? Isn't it a good thing to be able to live like that your entire life?' \n\n[Addendum by recorder]\nIs there a hint of envy in Insider's voice? I can't say for sure. \nI once thought Executor was the eccentric among the Sankta. After all, he seems so unusual, so out of place, and doesn't even bother to disguise it. But Insider? I really can't say; he usually looks like just another cheery and carefree Sankta, so I'd always thought he was the most ordinary of them all. \nNow, it looks like I've made a grave error in my judgement. \nIt would seem he simply wants to become an ordinary Sankta.",

It sounded like something exploded. I had just arrived home, and was busy cleaning the place up and tidying my wardrobe. The season was about to change, so I thought I should prepare in advance... Oh, right, I didn't take it seriously and go next door to take a look, since it was just your average everyday explosion we're all used to. Generally speaking, as long as it isn't knocking some wall down, it's usually not a big deal. \nBut soon I felt something was amiss. A smell came from my neighbor's side, um... It's hard to describe it, but if I were to use a metaphor, it's probably like... canned fin that was kept in storage for thirty years, the text on its label already worn out from age... No, not just that, add in some unadulterated Victorian patterned cheese too... Then mix them together and heat it up until it suddenly bursts. Uh, the stinging shock smelled something like that, you know? Sorry, it really is hard to describe, but I think my sense of smell might have been a little off then. \nAnyway, the fire started shortly after that smell wafted over. Yes, I was the one who extinguished it, and also the one who reported the incident. And the Notarial Hall staff who handled it... Um, haha, that was me too. It wasn't that big of a problem: the fire was discovered early, so it didn't damage the neighborhood much. The Notarial Hall deals with incidents of this scope about five to eight times a day. Some things at home were slightly affected—the wall and a cabinet by the door got a little singed—but nothing particularly valuable was damaged. I made a list to save you guys some time, so you can basically get off work as soon as we're done with this transcript. \nBy the way, my neighbor was trying to make a dessert called 'Thunderburst Pious Saint Cake.' I don't know if they succeeded, but if they keep at it, I might just consider moving. \nList of damaged property: \nCircles Donut Store Limited Edition Pajamas (Top piece) \nPair of fluffy slippers \nThree-tier wooden cabinet \nTwo pairs of dumbbells \nSelf-made decorative painting \nOther: \nSeveral discount coupons from major supermarkets in the city, no compensation required",

A Sankta's gun.\nRichele remembers—the old man at church had a gun too. He treasured his gun like nothing else, wouldn't bring it out just for anything, but one time he let Richele touch it, because he was the same as him, a Sankta.\n'Young man, you should have a gun too.'\nThe old man looked into his eyes, seeming to mean something by it, though Richele wasn't quite able to tell what.\nShould he have a gun?\nIt wasn't something he'd ever thought about.\nHe'd always been pretty much like the other kids on his street. They whiled away the time wandering about the city, scuffling every which where, doing odd jobs for the famiglie, fighting over the right to play at some machine in the arcade and calling it a 'turf war'... If that described him, should he have a gun?\n'Young man, what are you getting distracted for right now?'\nThe Sankta before him gives him a light few nudges with the gun. \n'Aren't you scared? Aren't you worried I'll pull the trigger?'\n'You're not going to, Mister. Because... um, I heard, we can't hurt our own people? Isn't that how it works?'\nBut this was just sophistry.\nThou mayst not harm thy kin. That's what the old man at church said, and he thinks that's what he meant. He has some recollection of it, but he's never paid it much mind.\nRichele carefully scrutinizes the Sankta before him. Travel-worn, but with clothes all neat and tidy, and looking in good health.\nAre he and this person kin? It's hard to say.\n'You're not wrong. We can't point guns at our own people.'\nSays the Sankta. But. There's always a but—\n'*clack*.'\nThe sound of pulling a trigger.\nRichele holds his breath in that instant, and fiercely throws himself to the side. He feels no despair at this turn of events, he simply hopes he can avoid the fatal shot, and—\n'...Whuh?'\nHe feels a faint sting on his forehead. Something falls, sweeping past the bridge of his nose, and Richele grabs it.\nIt's a piece of candy.\n'And that's to say, nice to meet you.'\nThe Sankta grins, no longer tensed up like before. He gives the prank item that spat out the candy a spin around his finger, then hands it to Richele. 'We know you from the head of the chapel. He asked if we could pick you up on our way back.'\nHe shoots Richele a wink, and says:\n'What do you think, Richele? You want to get out of here... come with us, and live back in Laterano?'",
