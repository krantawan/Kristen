She was a Texas, no matter how much she detested everything to do with the family.\nShe knew the price she paid when she chose to step away from it all.\nWas it worth it?\nShe asked herself this many times, and unsurprisingly was never able to find the answer.\nAfter leaving Columbia and Siracusa, she desperately sought a new life to replace the old one.\nFor her, life is not about searching for meaning; it was life itself that was worth searching for.\nFortunately, she found what she was looking for.",

However, this is no more than the calm before the storm.\nTexas knows this, as do the rest of Penguin Logistics.\nAt present, the main reason for them to travel between Lungmen and Nuova Volsinii is not so much Texas as Sora.\nThe success of La Morte di Texas made Sora a star, prompting Monster Siren Records to change its strategy and encourage her to continue her activities in Siracusa. Nuova Volsinii presents an ideal platform for Sora in more ways than one.\nIt was Sora, then, who has to regularly make the trip to Nuova Volsinii.\nMeanwhile, not wishing to let this opportunity go to waste, Croissant approached Bison and is trying to work with MountainDash Logistics and Vigil to build an international logistics route. It is a monumental task, but Croissant seems to enjoy it.\nExusiai, for her part, has made it her mission to try every pizza parlor in Siracusa and find the best.\nFor now, Texas is the one who is most idle.\nShe knows, however, that there is something tying them together.

She does not want to leave too many traces there, and Vigil respects her decision. He has not interfered with Penguin Logistics's new Nuova Volsinii branch, and there are few among the mafiosi who know where the last Texas went after her brief reappearance in Volsinii.\nOf course, things are constantly changing.\nThe waves that Bernardo stirred have calmed, but the families have begun to stir again. Siracusa's balance teeters on a precipice, leaving precious little time for Nuova Volsinii to grow peacefully.\nAt the same time, the game that the Signori dei Lupi have played for many years has come to the surface. This round is coming to an end, and the impact it will have on Siracusa is yet unknown.\nThe only thing that is certain is that change is coming to Siracusa.\nShould she claim power, or at least associate herself with it, in the name of the greater good? Texas knows that the answer <i>should</i> be 'yes,' yet she has chosen to distance herself from Vigil and Penance.\nHer line of thinking is simple. She does not belong to that greater good; she is simply one of the common folk, who felt outraged out of the goodness of her heart.

      "desc": "Nothing could be more stupid than having to name your own weapon, Texas thinks, staring at the form in front of her.\nNuova Volsinii forbids the carrying of weapons, even hidden ones, but Penguin Logistics is without a doubt a special case. Hence, their need to file a little additional registration. It doesn't mean they can use weapons in urban areas, but simply that under certain circumstances, their weapons will be returned to them.\nWhich is not to say she has to go through something as dumb as weapon NAMING, of course, it's justâ€”she sees Exusiai elatedly wracking the ol' noggin and filling in names she came up with a second ago for each one of her guns, and she catches the gaze Exusiai throws her way from time to timeâ€” appreciation mixed with eagernessâ€”and she knows that if she doesn't do it herself, Exusiai will snatch away her paperwork and give her two new swords names so stupid you'd call them groundbreaking.\nShe really can't say she's all that invested in these blades, given that she only reluctantly accepted them as a gift in the first place. Frankly, she's not even the type to get hung up on this stuffâ€”if the swords she'd been using before weren't of fairly unique make, she'd probably have changed weapons several times over by now.\nMoreover, the maker of these twin swords was doubtlessly trying to draw some sort of... spiritual thing from the story of the Texas family name, which was then affixed squarely on top. And despite the fact that it made even more headache for her, it led even the official inspecting her weapons to cast her an expectant look, as if to say 'surely, arms such as these must have wonderful names.'\nThe door opens with a groan, and in come Sora and Croissant toting bags of all sizes. Their new base is in dire need of dressing up, and the two of them have always been on decor duty.\n'Oh my gosh, Texas, you've been sitting there for three hours,' Sora can't help but exclaim when she finds, after moving to Texas's side, that the form is still in the exact same shape as when she left.\nTexas gives a shrug of the shoulders, hands the pen to her, and makes it clear: Texas is checked out.\n'I'm busy sorting out the base! I can't help you with this,' Sora says, mouth curling to one side. 'Besides, it's not like this family stuff has anything to do with meâ€”I'm just some performer.'\nTexas rolls her eyes. She'd finally laid out her whole past to her friends, and now it was nothing more than a harmless joke between them. She shoots a look at Croissant, but the Forte raises her hands as if to say she's all tied up herself. Still, something seems to hit her immediately after, and she pulls something out of a bag and slings it to Texas.\n'Bought it on the way. Think it over nice 'n slow, nowâ€”ya got plenty time 'n all.'\nTexas catches it, looks down, and finds it's a box of chocolates.\nHaving said her piece, Croissant heads into the kitchen. She's bought a bumper crop of cookware, and tonight will be her first time flexing her skills in Nuova Volsinii.\nSora switches a new record onto the gramophone. Melodious music fills the new base, while she begins to read the script she has in hand. She's gotten a new job, no doubt.\nExusiai's battle with her forms seems to be nearing a close, and one look at her face tells you she's pretty damn satisfied with what she's accomplished, but Texas knows the next time she fetches her weapons, she's not going to remember a single one of the names she thought up here.\nThis is my life now.\nTexas tears open the packaging, pulls out a stick and begins to slowly chew on it, but the feel of the chocolate as it gradually melts in her mouth, on top of everything she sees and hears and senses right now, leads to a moment of inspiration.\nShe promptly puts pen to form, fills in the name 'Blueberry & Dark Chocolate' a few times before tossing the pen aside.\nExusiai leans in to steal a glance, and bluntly tells her, 'I gotta say, partner, those are <i>really</i> stupid names.'\n'I agree.' Texas leans back in her office chair, gives her body a stretch, and puts her earphones on. 'But that's just the right amount of stupid.'"
