While there was some befuddlement over him claiming to be a veterinarian, it soon became clear that he was serious about being a vet here, given how much time he spends in the pen and the number of veterinary and ecology-related papers he has published in Rhodes Island's internal newsgroup.\nToday, his name is widely known amongst Rhodes Island's pet owners, who have seen their beloved pets become happier and healthier under Harold's care, and learned more about animals under his tutelage.\nNot everything has been smooth sailing for him at Rhodes Island, however.\nIt was a sunny afternoon, and Harold was explaining burdenbeast facts to operators visiting the pen.\nHe asked for a volunteer to demonstrate milking, and he got one: Siege, who happened to be at Rhodes Island that day.\nFor the first time since he arrived, Harold looked uncomfortable. Though he quickly recovered and began instructing her on milking, it was obvious to everyone that his movements were stiffer than usual.\n\nVery well, I admit it, I was startled at first. But then I realized I was just an old man who came here to get his men's illnesses treated and enjoy some peace and quiet. What Her Royal Highness gets up to and where is none of my business, is it? Oh, Her Royal Hi—I mean, <i>Siege</i> said she was interested in the habits of burdenbeasts. I should get the materials together now. Ta-ta!",

I was therefore asked to have a look at his room at night.\nI had said hi to him earlier in the evening, when I saw him heading into his room from the corridor, so I thought he'd gone to bed when I saw a bump under the blanket, only to realize that it was a pillow and that he had snuck out.\nI frantically searched everywhere, only to find him in the cafeteria, where he was drinking with the soldiers he brought with him to Rhodes Island. I was fuming, of course, but he didn't seem the slightest bit agitated when he saw me, instead calling me over.\nThey explained that one of the soldiers had been having nightmares of the war. Harold told me that he put the pillow there so I wouldn't worry. They'd gotten up in the middle of the night to comfort their comrade by having a drink with him.\nI sat down with them and listened to their war stories, and how their comrade came down with his condition. It was moving.\nHarold said they didn't drink because they wanted to; they drank to drown their sorrows. I can't help but feel sorry for them. Maybe I can talk to the Doctor, see if we can relax things a little...\n\nCome to the control room and check out the security footage, when you can. They were very much enjoying themselves until they noticed you, at which point they exchanged a look and put on that pity play. Then they started partying again as soon as you left.\nCan't have been the first time they put on that act either, given how smooth the whole thing was. No wonder the Doctor gave me a heads-up.\n- Closure\n\n[Operation Log]\nMay 24\nThanks for the heads-up, Closure! I won't be fooled again.\nNothing happened today.\n\nYou might've fooled me too, if there weren't a few more hidden cameras Harold didn't know about.\nYou got so touched by their stories that you ended up drinking with them all night!\nWe need a different person on this job, Doctor.

Are you questioning my strategy?'\n'No, of course not, just making a few observations. See, this is the lay of the land, with one pass through the middle, and three tiny trails providing access from the side.\n'If I were the enemy, and I was facing a commander known for her frontal assaults, I would strengthen my defense down the middle, while sending people down the trails to flank the enemy.'\n'Makes sense. Are you suggesting I split the squad and send people to attack down the trails?'\n'No, no, only third-rate tacticians think that variety is the ultimate goal of tactics. But only the most cunning can fool <i>everyone</i>, because you can't help but leave traces of their own work.'\n'I don't get it.'\n'It's simple. Would you be willing to split your squad if I suggested it?'\n'No, that would be boring.'\n'Exactly. I just wanted to remind you of the potential risks. As a leader, you should be aware of all the dangers you face, and face them together with those by your side.'\n'How should I continue the assault from the front, then?'\n'It's simple. Have some people lie in wait atop the cliffs, and throw down roadblocks from above when the enemy comes around to attack you from behind. That would both cut them off from their main force and protect your rear.\n'Naturally, your retreat will be cut off too, but the fact that the enemy has split their troops simply makes them more vulnerable to a frontal assault by your main force. Victory is yours as long as you can defeat them before their troops can return to reinforce.'\n'Sounds like a great idea! Let's go with that. I thought you were just a doctor, Harold. Where did you learn all this?'\n'To tell the truth, I've led troops into battle before, but I found medicine to be far more interesting.'\n'That so? Well, I love battles, and so do the other kids.'\n'I would love war too, if all wars were as adorable. In any case, good luck, General Myrtle.'\n\nWhy is Harold getting along so well with Myrtle and her group of wargaming children?",

They say I've seen a lot, but it's nothing compared to what you've seen.\nWait, what's that vintage you just took out? Alright, very well, here's one I save for special occasions.\nWhen I was young, I didn't have the slightest doubt about my duty. I believed I was fighting for Victoria, for the greater good, until I lost my leg.\nThere's really nothing remarkable about the story. I stepped on a mine, lost a leg, spent a few months in bed, then went back to the frontlines after getting a prosthetic limb. It's a rare soldier who isn't missing a piece here or there, but I rarely tell people what I was thinking at the time.\nWhile I was lying in the doctor's tent like a mannikin, I saw for the first time my comrades being brought in, moaning in pain. Some of them recovered, others were taken away still moaning in pain, and yet others ended up with a white cloth draped over their face.\nFor the first time, I realized that when you stripped away the glamorous exterior of glory, all that's left is the pained cries of the soldiers, and hands dropping weakly off the sides of beds.\nThat was when I started to feel exhausted by war.\n...We've come this far, Doctor. Let me say a little more.\nI still remember the puzzled gazes upon me when I stepped into the world of high society for the first time. They were sharper than any sword and threatened to impale me, but I took it on the chin and kept walking.\nTo give your life for your country is an honor, but it should be by choice. No one was born to be sent to their death.\nThe reason I'm still working so hard at this age is to find a place for the poor bastards who've stuck it out with me all these years with so little to show for it, and to set my own mind at ease.\nNow, don't give me that look, I'm thankful that Rhodes Island is willing to accept a bunch of old invalids like us, with all the limbs we don't have. Besides, your burden's hardly any lighter than mine. Who's pitying who here?\nAs someone who's been there, though, the only advice I can give you is this: There's no greater happiness than being able to eat, drink, walk, and sleep. To have a few true friends, and a couple stiff drinks.\nA toast to your health, that we may see the sun rise again tomorrow.",

This old soldier, with but one leg to his name, no longer must weather the winter's bite in agony. But I must admit, I was taken aback to learn it hails from the pharmaceutical venture recently founded by Freya's brother. Why, that poor lad was still dwelling in squalor when I was on assignment in Kjerag! It seems he's amassed quite a fortune from peddling his medicines to the Victorians, hasn't he? A new company and all its trappings!\nHowever, upon scrutinizing the spray's formula, I couldn't help but notice its striking resemblance to the concoction I once used for mending fractures on burdenbeasts. Just a few additional herbs from Kjerag, and it performs like no other remedy I've encountered. Truly, you must be under Kjeragandr's divine protection.\nEverything good with you and Freya? How is the burdenbeast rental business going? You mentioned plans to build an abode by the Lake Silberneherze—why have I not yet seen any photographs of this endeavor? I eagerly await the day I can pay a visit to you both. And some good news: I spoke with the Chief of the Silverash Family about you and Freya, and I am pleased to report he did not oppose your union. Live your lives well, my friend.\nSpeaking of which, I find it quite difficult to fathom the intricacies of a Kjerag wedding. Forgive my curiosity, but do you exchange your vows by the serene waters of Lake Silberneherze or in Hoff Angrsaal? Before the revered statue of Kjeragandr? Must the parents of the betrothed be present as well? Regardless, I wish you a joyous marriage. And should any of your burdenbeasts suffer a broken leg once more, simply let me know.\nAfter all, when people's fortune in war is as grim as mine, we have no other choice but to help each other 'replant legs', and carry on. I may be a noble, but a fancy hat does not change the nature of this hapless creature underneath. I may possess the knowledge to mend the limbs of burdenbeasts, yet I remain at a loss when it comes to mending my own, or those of others. Allow this old cripple to extend his pity to his 'own kind'—Might you, through your pharmaceutical connections, explore whether there are other Victorian soldiers in need of their legs 'replanted'?\nI earnestly hope that, in the near future, everyone may walk on strong, healthy legs.\nHarold",
