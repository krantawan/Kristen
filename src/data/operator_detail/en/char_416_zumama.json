However, when Closure christened the newly rebuilt Big Ugly 'the Raging Ironhide', she took the opportunity to give herself a new codename based on her tribe's name—'Eunectes.' \nThat being said, a sizable number of our operators, such as Gavial, still call her by her name. \nBased on her own personal account, she rarely ever picks fights with anyone, her frequent bouts with Gavial during their childhoods notwithstanding.

Of course, Lancet-2 is fairly popular amongst operators thanks to her personality, but Eunectes's passion for her is on another level. \nIt isn't hard to fathom why, of course. \nMost of us have probably been so awestruck by something we've never so much as heard of that it sent chills down our spines at some point in our lives. The kind of moment that feels as though you flung open a whole new door, like discovering new untrodden lands. To Eunectes, that moment came as a child when she witnessed a nomadic city just passing through by chance. The gigantic machine, colored in its icy machinery colors, struck her with amazement like never before. That moment came again when she first heard Lancet-2 talk. This time, it was the possibilities that robotics has that struck her with amazement. \nWouldn't most operators be just as surprised when they first come across operations platforms that talk? The difference here is that most operators aren't all that interested in robots and therefore don't react the same way Eunectes does. \nOn the other hand, while Eunectes shows extraordinary respect to other operations platforms as well, Lancet-2 is particularly dear to her. This is actually a glimpse of her normalcy. \nHer special treatment for Lancet-2 can be described as ritualistic and as a sort of emotional sustenance. This is a beacon she picked for herself in her new life, and it can even be seen as the manifestation of what she has always dreamt of achieving herself. \nWhich is why, even though she's the developer of all the operations platforms and the person that Eunectes has come to look up to as her master, Closure has never tried to put a stop to her so-called stupid apprentice's behavior. She probably knows exactly how Eunectes feels.",

By its very essence, it's an idea that runs against their traditions—a breakthrough. \nFrom this point of view, you could say Gavial was the manifestation of tradition itself. She believed in her own strength and didn't seek any outside help. Having abided by this principle for years, this has become one of the most iconic examples of Acahuallan tradition.\nIn other words, by its very essence, this series of events can be seen as a conflict between traditions and breakthroughs. If it wasn't for Gavial's relationship with Eunectes, if it wasn't for the region's lax sense of tradition to begin with, and how modest the Acahuallan people were, history tells us all this would have ended very badly. \nOf course, that is simply conjecture, and this isn't to say that we were lucky things turned out the way they did. Rather, I wanted to pose an interesting question:\nIf Gavial and Eunectes each represented a different lifestyle—Gavial's being the primitive yet free lifestyle while Eunectes represented a more orderly lifestyle that relied upon tools—would we be able to say for sure that one is more correct and would lead to a better life? \nTo take this question one step further, what makes a good lifestyle? \nThere isn't a single correct answer to this question, but if you look at how Gavial and Eunectes are such polar opposites yet alike in some ways, I believe this would be an interesting question to ponder.",

As such, we only brought with us a small number of its spare parts on the way back. \nThe unit we have now is a brand new unit that the whole Engineering Department worked together to rebuild. The Chief Engineer named it 'the Raging Ironhide.' \nOn the outside, this new unit isn't all that different from its predecessor. Inside, however, it couldn't be more different from the haphazardly put-together Big Ugly. It was the fruit of the whole Engineering Department putting their heads together. And supposedly, Eunectes broke down in tears at the workshop when it was finally completed.\nTo her, it was probably the most concrete step she has ever taken to make her dream a reality. \nAside from this, after the Raging Ironhide was completed, the High Priest, who Eunectes has occasionally mentioned as the Big Ugly's pilot, has started popping up frequently here in Rhodes Island. Dr. Kal'tsit has told the operators to pay it no mind. That kind of bothered me at first, but thanks to the High Priest's happy-go-lucky personality, it didn't take long for everyone to get used to having it around.",

Testing, restoration and upgrades of all-new energy emission devices in the training grounds\n3. Improved designs for remote-control drone swarm weapon mounting plans.\n4. Servicing of Rhodes Island Landship automated navigation systems.\n5. Self-researched planning for some machine hyper-remodeling, audited and launched with the Engineering Department.\n......\n12. Daily maintenance, painting, and emotional communication with and guidance of intelligent operation platform Lancet-2 (note: applied for by Operator herself and not conducted under official Engineering Department authority. Engineering Department does not interfere excessively in light of Lancet-2's behavioral non-rejection of Eunectes).\n......\nOverall evaluation:\nOperator Eunectes has participated in multiple projects and displayed impressive performance in all aspects since joining the Engineering Department, and now tentatively possesses the capacity to research, develop and work independently.\n......\nSupplement from Officer-in-Charge (directly dictated):\nJeez, do we have to make these evaluations so formal every time? Could be doing WORK here... If someone's my disciple, they're worth educating. She learned how to test microcapacitor unit performance and then straight away, she managed to fumble a whole breadboard together! She's gifted! Really resembles me there! And she's hardworking. Read through every single engineering book the landship has over the past half year, and she finds people to discuss with everywhere. They don't put half of the true might of technology to print, though. She's got a lot more to learn. As for why she's so eager, well, don't ask me. Probably hasn't scooped her jaw up from the floor since she landed on Rhodes Island... She's had two sorta major awakenings in her life, right? First was seeing a nomadic city pass by with her own eyes when she was a kid, second was seeing a talking Lancet-2 in Acahualla. I can see the hopes in her, for machines, for herself. There's a possibility in there... in the not-distant future, I bet she'll be able to build machines with her own two hands that surprise even herself. Maybe her creations will lead Terra in technological innovation. I might just hand my Chief Engineer position to her when the time comes, it's not out of the question... That last one was a joke, don't write it down.\n\nDate: Dec 13\nApprover: Closure",

Zumama couldn't figure it out, try as she might over three straight sleepless nights.\nGavial saw the heavy bags under Zumama's eyes, and on one hand showed the appropriate concern, while the other hand was clenched in a fist as unreserved as ever. Zumama crashed to the floor, but showed no hurry to get back up.\n'Old Man Zuluzhak said those things were nomadic cities. What's a nomadic city?' Zumama asked as she stared up at the blue sky, giving her friend the same question that had been bothering her for three whole days. She'd never been this hung up before. Even the mushrooms she'd never seen before growing on trees only lingered on her mind for a day and a half.\nGavial gave an answer she considered incredibly wise, a saying she'd heard from Old Man Zuluzhak. 'It is why it is, and that's why it is.' Then she started pumping her arms. 'You rested enough, Zumama? Let's keep going!'\nZumama suddenly felt a little listless. She got up, and walked off to where the nomadic city had sailed past. Its outline was still faintly visible, but her eyes could see far further than her feet could take her. How could a child's gait ever catch up to a sailing machine? Sunset came, and she felt the distance between her and the nomadic city hadn't narrowed one bit.\nShe felt somewhat dejected, and gloomily sat on the ground, but bumped against something as she did. From underneath her, she pulled out a strange metallic ring. Zumama had once witnessed the most experienced boy of the tribe show off roughly the same thing. What was it called, again? A short name... a 'nud'? Maybe a 'nup'?\nZumama put it in her pocket. It was likely the thing hadn't even come off the nomadic city—it was just some careless traveler's dropped belonging—but all the same, Zumama loved it, very much.\nShe began to collect these abandoned and scrapped metal parts, putting them together with no principle whatsoever. At first, she bound them with thread, then stuck them together with glue, until she eventually learned from a passing caravan what welding was.\nFinally, one day, this strange little contraption was born from Zumama's hands. Gavial and Tomimi's verdict was 'ugly', but still, she loved it, very much.\nShe clasped it in her hands, and came to where she once saw that nomadic city. It had long since vanished, but Zumama always had a feeling she could sense the tremors from it as it sailed.\nSuddenly, a strange Liberi showed up beside her, and asked, 'What's on your mind there, young lady?'\nShe tightly gripped the tiny, ugly little thing in her hands, so hard her fingers hurt.\n'I want to make it move.'",
